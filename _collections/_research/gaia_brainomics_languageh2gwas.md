title: The genetic architecture of language functional connectivity
cat: gaia
subcat: brainomics
teasing: Using data from the UK Biobank, the world's largest general population imaging-genetics cohort, a collaboration led by a team at BAOBAB (NeuroSpin) has identified genes involved in the genetic architecture of functional language connectivity. These genes could be a priority for studying natural language.
