title: A Large-Scale Multi-Site Brain MRI Data-set for Age Prediction and Debiasing
cat: gaia
subcat: platform
teasing: BHB aggregates 10 publicly available datasets. Currently, it is focused only on Healthy Controls (HC) since the main challenge consists in modeling the (normal) brain development by building a robust brain age predictor. BHB contains N=5330 3D T1 brain MRI scans from HC acquired on 71 different acquisition sites coming from European-American, European, and Asian individuals. BHB provides the participants phenotype as well as site and scanner information associated with each image. Some widespread confounds are also proposed, such as the Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), the CerebroSpinal Fluid Volume (CSFV), the Gray Matter Volume (GMV), and the White Matter Volume (WMV).
