        Study of the variability of the cortical mantle thickness is now a key issue in neuroimaging. Here we describe a more recent trend aiming at the study of the variability of the cortical folding morphology.
        Recent findings 
        Computerized three-dimensional versions of gyrification index and other morphometric features dedicated to the folding patterns are modified in psychiatric syndromes and neurologic disorders. These observations provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in abnormal development or abnormal aging.

	abstract = {Cognitive success at school and later in life is supported by executive functions including cognitive control (CC). The pFC plays a major role in CC, particularly the dorsal part of ACC or midcingulate cortex. Genes, environment (including school curricula), and neuroplasticity affect CC. However, no study to date has investigated whether ACC sulcal pattern, a stable brain feature primarily determined in utero, influences CC efficiency in the early stages of cognitive and neural development. Using anatomical MRI and three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical folds, we investigated the effect that ACC sulcal pattern may have on the Stroop score, a classical behavioral index of CC efficiency, in 5-year-old preschoolers. We found higher CC efficiency, that is, lower Stroop interference scores for both RTs and error rates, in children with asymmetrical ACC sulcal pattern (i.e., different pattern in each hemisphere) compared with children with symmetrical pattern (i.e., same pattern in both hemispheres). Critically, ACC sulcal pattern had no effect on performance in the forward and backward digit span tasks suggesting that ACC sulcal pattern contributes to the executive ability to resolve conflicts but not to the ability to maintain and manipulate information in working memory. This finding provides the first evidence that preschoolers' CC efficiency is likely associated with ACC sulcal pattern, thereby suggesting that the brain shape could result in early constraints on human executive ability.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0122252},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are mainly located in the frontal region, with a particular tropism for the central sulcus. Up to 30\% of lesions are undetected (magnetic resonance [MR]-negative FCD patients) or belatedly diagnosed by visual analysis of MR images. We propose an automated sulcus-based method to analyze abnormal sulcal patterns associated with central FCD, taking into account the normal interindividual sulcal variability.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 29 right-handed patients with FCD in the central region (including 12 MR negative histologically-confirmed cases) and 29 right-handed controls. The analysis of sulcal abnormalities from T1-weighted MR imaging (MRI) was performed using a graph-based representation of the cortical folds and an automated sulci recognition system, providing a new quantitative criterion to describe sulcal patterns, termed sulcus energy.
RESULTS: Group analysis showed that the central sulcus in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the FCD exhibited an abnormal sulcal pattern compared with controls (p = 0.032). FCDs were associated with abnormal patterns of the central sulci compared with controls (p = 0.006), a result that remained significant when MR-negative and MR-positive patients were considered separately, while the effects of sex, age and MR-field were not significant. At the individual level, sulcus energy alone failed to detect the FCD lesion. We found, however, a significant association between maximum z-scores and the site of FCD (p = 0.0046) which remained significant in MR-negative (p = 0.024) but not in MR-positive patients (p = 0.058). The maximum z-score pointed to an FCD sulcus in four MR-negative and five MR-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified abnormal sulcal patterns in patients with FCD of the central region compared with healthy controls. The abnormal sulcal patterns ipsilateral to the FCD and the link between sulcus energy and the FCD location strengthen the interest of sulcal abnormalities in FCD patients.},

	abstract = {The deformable atlas paradigm has been at the core of computational anatomy during the last two decades. Spatial normalization is the variant endowing the atlas with a coordinate system used for voxel-based aggregation of images across subjects and studies. This framework has largely contributed to the success of brain mapping. Brain spatial normalization, however, is still ill-posed because of the complexity of the human brain architecture and the lack of architectural landmarks in standard morphological MRI. Multi-atlas strategies have been developed during the last decade to overcome some difficulties in the context of segmentation. A new generation of registration algorithms embedding architectural features inferred for instance from diffusion or functional MRI is on the verge to improve the architectural value of spatial normalization. A better understanding of the architectural meaning of the cortical folding pattern will lead to use some sulci as complementary constraints. Improving the architectural compliance of spatial normalization may impose to relax the diffeomorphic constraint usually underlying atlas warping. A two-level strategy could be designed: in each region, a dictionary of templates of incompatible folding patterns would be collected and matched in a way or another using rare architectural information, while individual subjects would be aligned using diffeomorphisms to the closest template. Manifold learning could help to aggregate subjects according to their morphology. Connectivity-based strategies could emerge as an alternative to deformation-based alignment leading to match the connectomes of the subjects rather than images.},

	abstract = {The strong positive-allometric relationship between brain size, cortical extension and gyrification complexity, recently highlighted in the general population, could be modified by brain developmental disorders. Indeed, in case of brain growth insufficiency, the pathophysiological relevance of the "simplified gyral pattern" phenotype is strongly disputed since almost no genotype-phenotype correlations have been found in primary microcephalies. Using surface scaling analysis and newly-developed spectral analysis of gyrification (Spangy), we tested whether the gyral simplification in groups of severe microcephalies related to ASPM, PQBP1 or fetal-alcohol-syndrome could be fully explained by brain size reduction according to the allometric scaling law established in typically-developing control groups, or whether an additional disease effect was to be suspected. We found the surface area reductions to be fully explained by scaling effect, leading to predictable folding intensities measured by gyrification indices. As for folding pattern assessed by spectral analysis, scaling effect also accounted for the majority of the variations, but an additional negative or positive disease effect was found in the case of ASPM and PQBP1-linked microcephalies, respectively. Our results point out the necessity of taking allometric scaling into account when studying the gyrification variability in pathological conditions. They also show that the quantitative analysis of gyrification complexity through spectral analysis can enable distinguishing between even (predictable, non-specific) and uneven (unpredictable, maybe disease-specific) gyral simplifications.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-functioning autism (HFA) and schizophrenia (SZ) are two of the main neurodevelopmental disorders, sharing several clinical dimensions and risk factors. Their exact relationship is poorly understood, and few studies have directly compared both disorders. Our aim was thus to directly compare neuroanatomy of HFA and SZ using a multimodal MRI design.
METHODS: We scanned 79 male adult subjects with 3T MRI (23 with HFA, 24 with SZ and 32 healthy controls, with similar non-verbal IQ). We compared them using both diffusion-based whole-brain tractography and T1 voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: HFA and SZ groups exhibited similar white matter alterations in the left fronto-occipital inferior fasciculus with a decrease in generalized fractional anisotropy compared with controls. In grey matter, the HFA group demonstrated bilateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate increases in contrast with prefrontal and left temporal reductions in SZ.
CONCLUSION: HFA and SZ may share common white matter deficits in long-range connections involved in social functions, but opposite grey matter abnormalities in frontal regions that subserve complex cognitive functions. Our results are consistent with the fronto-occipital underconnectivity theory of HFA and the altered connectivity hypothesis of SZ and suggest the existence of both associated and diametrical liabilities to these two conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal maturation of brain connectivity is supposed to underlie the dysfunctional emotion regulation in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). To test this hypothesis, white matter integrity is usually investigated using measures of water diffusivity provided by MRI. Here we consider a more intuitive aspect of the morphometry of the white matter tracts: the shape of the fibre bundles, which is associated with neurodevelopment. We analyzed the shape of 3 tracts involved in BD: the cingulum (CG), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and arcuate fasciculus (AF).
METHODS: We analyzed diffusion MRI data in patients with BD and healthy controls. The fibre bundles were reconstructed using Q-ball-based tractography and automated segmentation. Using Isomap, a manifold learning method, the differences in the shape of the reconstructed bundles were visualized and quantified.
RESULTS: We included 112 patients and 82 controls in our analysis. We found the left AF of patients to be further extended toward the temporal pole, forming a tighter hook than in controls. We found no significant difference in terms of shape for the left UF, the left CG or the 3 right fasciculi. However, in patients compared with controls, the ventrolateral branch of the left UF in the orbitofrontal region had a tendency to be larger, and the left CG of patients had a tendency to be smaller in the frontal lobe and larger in the parietal lobe.
LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the left AF in patients with BD. The statistical tendencies observed for the left UF and left CG deserve further study.},

Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of pathogenesis triggered by abnormal connectivity.

For each subject, the complete cortico-cortical tractogram is first split into sub-tractograms connecting pairs of gyri. Then intra-subject shape-based fiber clustering performs compression of each sub-tractogram into a set of bundles. Proceeding further with shape-based clustering provides a match of the bundles across subjects. Bundles found in most of the subjects are instantiated in the atlas. To increase robustness, this procedure was performed with two independent groups of subjects, in order to discard bundles without match across the two independent atlases. Finally, the resulting intersection atlas was projected on a third independent group of subjects in order to filter out bundles without reproducible and reliable projection. The final multi-subject diffusion-based U-fiber atlas is composed of 100 bundles in total, 50 per hemisphere, from which 35 are common to both hemispheres.},

A rightward asymmetry of the surface area was seen in development between both examinations except for the LF, which showed a leftward asymmetry at both time points. Second, lower birth weight z-score, multiple pregnancy and prolonged mechanical ventilation showed negative effects on cortical folding of the CS, LF, INS, STS and PCS, mainly on the first examination, suggesting that sulci developing the earliest were the most affected by clinical factors.

In this study, we aimed to identify and describe its consequences beyond the lack of callosal fibres, on the morphology, microstructure and asymmetries of the main white matter bundles with diffusion imaging and fibre tractography. Seven children aged between 9 and 13 years old and seven age- and gender-matched control children were studied. First, we focused on bundles within the mesial region of the cerebral hemispheres: the corpus callosum, Probst bundles and cingulum which were selected using a conventional region-based approach. We demonstrated that the Probst bundles have a wider connectivity than the previously described rostrocaudal direction, and a microstructure rather distinct from the cingulum but relatively close to callosal remnant fibres. A sigmoid bundle was found in two partial ageneses. Second, the corticospinal tract, thalamic radiations and association bundles were extracted automatically via an atlas of adult white matter bundles to overcome bias resulting from a priori knowledge of the bundles' anatomical morphology and trajectory. Despite the lack of callosal fibres and the colpocephaly observed in CCD, all major white matter bundles were identified with a relatively normal morphology, and preserved microstructure (i.e. fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity) and asymmetries. Consequently the bundles' organisation seems well conserved in brains with CCD. These results await further investigations with functional imaging before apprehending the cognition variability in children with isolated dysgenesis.},

By analyzing MR images obtained from 177 humans and 73 chimpanzees, we observed a human-specific asymmetry in the superior temporal sulcus at the heart of the communication regions and which we have named the "superior temporal asymmetrical pit" (STAP). This 45-mm-long segment ventral to Heschl's gyrus is deeper in the right hemisphere than in the left in 95\% of typical human subjects, from infanthood till adulthood, and is present, irrespective of handedness, language lateralization, and sex although it is greater in males than in females. The STAP also is seen in several groups of atypical subjects including persons with situs inversus, autistic spectrum disorder, Turner syndrome, and corpus callosum agenesis. It is explained in part by the larger number of sulcal interruptions in the left than in the right hemisphere. Its early presence in the infants of this study as well as in fetuses and premature infants suggests a strong genetic influence. Because this asymmetry is barely visible in chimpanzees, we recommend the STAP region during midgestation as an important phenotype to investigate asymmetrical variations of gene expression among the primate lineage. This genetic target may provide important insights regarding the evolution of the crucial cognitive abilities sustained by this sulcus in our species, namely communication and social cognition.},

	abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can interfere with linguistic performance when delivered over language areas. At low frequency (1 Hz), rTMS is assumed to decrease cortical excitability; however, the degree of TMS effect on cortical language areas may depend on the localization of the stimulation coil with respect to the inter-individual anatomo-functional variations. Hence, we aimed at investigating individual brain areas involved in semantic and phonological auditory processes. We hypothesized that active rTMS targeted over Wernicke's area might modify the performance during a language-fragment-detection task. Sentences in native or foreign languages were presented to 12 right-handed male healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 3D-functional maps localized the posterior temporal activation (Wernicke) in each subject and MRI anatomical cortical landmarks were used to define Broca's pars opercularis (F3Op). A frameless stereotaxy system was used to guide the TMS coil position over Wernicke's and F3Op areas in each subject. Active and placebo randomized rTMS sessions were applied at 1 Hz, 110{\textbackslash}\% of motor threshold, during the same language-fragment-detection task. Accuracy and response time (RT) were recorded. RT was significantly decreased by active rTMS compared to placebo over Wernicke's area, and was more decreased for native than for foreign languages. No significant RT change was observed for F3Op area. rTMS conditions did not impair participants' accuracy. Thus, low-frequency rTMS over Wernicke's area can speed-up the response to a task tapping on native language perception in healthy volunteers. This individually-guided stimulation study confirms that facilitatory effects are not confined to high-frequency rTMS.},

In healthy subjects, IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional successes later in life. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is one of the core structures responsible for IC. Although quantitative structural characteristics of the ACC contribute to IC efficiency, the qualitative structural brain characteristics contributing to IC development are less-understood. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether the ACC sulcal pattern at age 5, a stable qualitative characteristic of the brain determined in utero, explains IC at age 9. 18 children performed Stroop tasks at age 5 and age 9. Children with asymmetrical ACC sulcal patterns (n=7) had better IC efficiency at age 5 and age 9 than children with symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns (n=11). The ACC sulcal patterns appear to affect specifically IC efficiency given that the ACC sulcal patterns had no effect on verbal working memory. Our study provides the first evidence that the ACC sulcal pattern - a qualitative structural characteristic of the brain not affected by maturation and learning after birth - partially explains IC efficiency during childhood.},

We investigated cortico-striatal connectivity modifications occurring in HD patients using a novel approach which focuses on the projection of the connectivity profile of the basal ganglia onto the cortex. This approach consists in computing, for each subcortical structure, surface connectivity measures representing its strength of connections to the cortex and comparing these measures across groups. In this study, we focused on Huntington disease as an application of this new approach. First, surface cortico-striatal connectivity measures of a group of healthy subjects were averaged in order to infer the "normal" connectivity profile of the striatum to the cortex. Second, a statistical analysis was performed from the surface connectivity measures of healthy subjects and HD patients in order to detect the cortical gyri presenting altered cortico-striatal connectivity in HD. Lastly, percentage differences of connectivity between healthy subjects and patients were inferred, for each nucleus of the striatum, from the connectivity measures of the cortical gyri presenting a significant connectivity difference between the two groups. These percentage differences characterize the axonal disruptions between the striatum and the cortex occurring in HD. We found selective region-specific degeneration of cortical connections predominating for associative and primary sensorimotor connections and with relative preservation of limbic connections. Our method can be used to infer novel connectivity-based markers of HD pathological process.},

We focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - an intensely studied cortical region that presents two qualitatively distinct and reliably classifiable sulcal patterns with links to postnatal behavior. We show - without exception-that individual ACC sulcal patterns are fixed from childhood to adulthood, at the same time that quantitative anatomical ACC metrics are undergoing profound developmental change.

	abstract = {It is generally accepted in neuroscience that anatomy and function go hand in hand. Accordingly, a local morphological variability could lead to a corresponding functional variability. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by linking the variability of the cortical folding pattern of 252 right-handed subjects to the localization or the pattern of functional activations induced by hand motion or silent reading. Three regions are selected: the central sulcus, the precentral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). "Essential morphological variability traits" are identified using a method building upon multidimensional scaling. The link between variability in anatomy and function is confirmed by the perfect match between the central sulcus morphological "hand knob" and the corresponding motor activation: as the location of the hand knob moves more or less dorsally along the central sulcus, the motor hand activation moves accordingly. Furthermore, the size of the left hand activation in the right hemisphere is correlated with the knob location in the central sulcus. A new link between functional and morphological variability is discovered relative to the location of a premotor activation induced by silent reading. While this reading activation is located next to the wall of the central sulcus when the hand knob has a ventral positioning, it is pushed into a deep gyrus interrupting the precentral sulcus when the knob is more dorsal. Finally, it is shown that the size of the reading activation along the STS is larger when the posterior branches are less developed.},

	abstract = {The description of cortical folding pattern (CFP) is challenging because of geometric complexity and inter-subject variability. On a cortical surface mesh, curvature estimation provides a good scalar proxy of CFP. The oscillations of this function can be studied using a Fourier-like analysis to produce a power spectrum representative of the spatial frequency composition of CFP. First, we introduce an original method for the SPectral ANalysis of GYrication (Spangy), which performs a spectral decomposition of the mean curvature of the grey/white interface mesh based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator eigenfunctions. Spangy produces an ordered 7 bands power spectrum of curvature (B0-B6) and provides an anatomically relevant segmentation of CFP based on local spectral composition. A spatial frequency being associated with each eigenfunction, the bandwidth design assumes frequency doubling between consecutive spectral bands. Next, we observed that the last 3 spectral bands (B4, 5 and 6) accounted for 93\% of the analyzed spectral power and were associated with fold-related variations of curvature, whereas the lower frequency bands were related to global brain shape. The spectral segmentation of CFP revealed 1st, 2nd and 3rd order elements associated with B4, B5 and B6 respectively. These elements could be related to developmentally-defined primary, secondary and tertiary folds. Finally, we used allometric scaling of frequency bands power and segmentation to analyze the relationship between the spectral composition of CFP and brain size in a large adult dataset. Total folding power followed a positive allometric scaling which did not divide up proportionally between the bands: B4 contribution was constant, B5 increased like total folding power and B6 much faster. Besides, apparition of new elements of pattern with increasing size only concerned the 3rd order. Hence, we demonstrate that large brains are twistier than smaller ones because of an increased number of high spatial frequency folds, ramifications and kinks that accommodate the allometric increase of cortical surface.},

Here, for 375 individuals spanning 7 karyotype groups (XX, XY, XXX, XYY, XXY, XXYY, XXXXY), we use structural neuroimaging to measure a global sulcation index (SI, total sulcal/cortical hull area) and both determinants of sulcal area: total sulcal length and mean sulcal depth. We detail large and patterned effects of sex and SCD across all folding metrics, but show that these effects are in fact largely consistent with the normative scaling of cortical folding in health: larger human brains have disproportionately high SI due to a relative expansion of sulcal area versus hull area, which arises because disproportionate sulcal lengthening overcomes a lack of proportionate sulcal deepening. Accounting for these normative allometries reveals 1) brain size-independent sulcal lengthening in males versus females, and 2) insensitivity of overall folding architecture to SCD. Our methodology and findings provide a novel context for future studies of human cortical folding in health and disease.},

The presence of IHI was assessed on Ti-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed the association of IHI with other anatomical changes throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent in the left hippocampus (left: 17\%, right: 6\%, chi(2) - test, p {\textless} 10(-28)). Compared to subjects without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe.

We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas, and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time, the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages, while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric, thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result, a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover, parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds, respectively.

	abstract = {Background Previous studies have reported MRI abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), although only a few studies have directly compared callosal areas in psychotic versus nonpsychotic patients with this disorder. We sought to compare regional callosal areas in a large international multicentre sample of patients with BD and healthy controls. Methods We analyzed anatomic T-1 MRI data of patients with BD-I and healthy controls recruited from 4 sites (France, Germany, Ireland and the United States). We obtained the mid-sagittal areas of 7 CC subregions using an automatic CC delineation. Differences in regional callosal areas between patients and controls were compared using linear mixed models (adjusting for age, sex, handedness, brain volume, history of alcohol abuse/dependence, lithium or antipsychotic medication status, symptomatic status and site) and multiple comparisons correction. We also compared regional areas of the CC between patients with BD with and without a history of psychotic features. Results We included 172 patients and 146 controls in our study. Patients with BD had smaller adjusted mid-sagittal CC areas than controls along the posterior body, the isthmus and the splenium of the CC. Patients with a positive history of psychotic features had greater adjusted area of the rostral CC region than those without a history of psychotic features. Limitations We found small to medium effect sizes, and there was no calibration technique among the sites. Conclusion Our results suggest that BD with psychosis is associated with a different pattern of interhemispheric connectivity than BD without psychosis and could be considered a relevant neuroimaging subtype of BD.},

	abstract = {Group studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets are usually based on the computation of the mean signal across subjects at each voxel (random effects analyses), assuming that all subjects have been set in the same anatomical space (normalization). Although this approach allows for a correct specificity (rate of false detections), it is not very efficient for three reasons: i) its underlying hypotheses, perfect coregistration of the individual datasets and normality of the measured signal at the group level are frequently violated; ii) the group size is small in general, so that asymptotic approximations on the parameters distributions do not hold; iii) the large size of the images requires some conservative strategies to control the false detection rate, at the risk of increasing the number of false negatives. Given that it is still very challenging to build generative or parametric models of intersubject variability, we rely on a rule based, bottom-up approach: we present a set of procedures that detect structures of interest from each subject's data, then search for correspondences across subjects and outline the most reproducible activation regions in the group studied. This framework enables a strict control on the number of false detections. It is shown here that this analysis demonstrates increased validity and improves both the sensitivity and reliability of group analyses compared with standard methods. Moreover, it directly provides information on the spatial position correspondence or variability of the activated regions across subjects, which is difficult to obtain in standard voxel-based analyses.},

	abstract = {We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to visualize the cerebral processing of unseen masked words. Within the areas associated with conscious reading, masked words activated left extrastriate, fusiform and precentral areas. Furthermore, masked words reduced the amount of activation evoked by a subsequent conscious presentation of the same word. In the left fusiform gyrus, this repetition suppression phenomenon was independent of whether the prime and target shared the same case, indicating that case-independent information about letter strings was extracted unconsciously. In comparison to an unmasked situation, however, the activation evoked by masked words was drastically reduced and was undetectable in prefrontal and parietal areas, correlating with participants' inability to report the masked words.},

However, the tensor model can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel. New emerging approaches have been proposed to obtain a better representation of the diffusion process occurring in fiber crossing. In this paper, we adapt a tracking algorithm to the q-ball representation, which results from a spherical Radon transform of high angular resolution data. This algorithm is based on a Monte-Carlo strategy, using regularized particle trajectories to sample the white matter geometry. The method is validated using a phantom of bundle crossing made up of haemodialysis fibers. The method is also applied to the detection of the auditory tract in three human subjects.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion imaging provides a valuable tool used for inferring structural anisotropy of brain white matter connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular resolution diffusion models were introduced in order to overcome the inadequacy of the tensor model for describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR signal and the orientation distribution function (ODF). Experimental validation of these methods in a model system is necessary to determine the accuracy of the methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter to axons) bundles, crossing at 90 degrees , was designed and dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal configurations of underlying structures. Three-dimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the crossing area. Principal orientations were estimated from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions, QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of 19 degrees and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of 30 degrees .},

	abstract = {Analysis of brain structure in Turner syndrome (TS) provides the opportunity to identify the consequences of the loss of one X chromosome on brain anatomy and to characterize the neural bases underlying the specific cognitive profile of TS subjects which includes deficits in spatial-numerical processing and social cognition. Fourteen subjects with TS and fourteen controls were investigated using voxel-based analysis of high resolution anatomical and diffusion tensor images and using sulcal morphometry. The analysis of anatomical images provided evidence for macroscopical changes in cortical regions involved in social cognition such as the left superior temporal sulcus and orbito-frontal cortex and in a region involved in spatial and numerical cognition such as the right intraparietal sulcus. Diffusion tensor images showed a displacement of the grey-white matter interface of the left and right superior temporal sulcus and revealed bilateral microstuctural anomalies in the temporal white matter. The analysis of fiber orientation suggests specific alterations of fiber tracts connecting posterior to anterior temporal regions. Last, sulcal morphometry confirmed the anomalies of the left and right superior temporal sulci and of the right intraparietal sulcus. Our results thus provide converging evidence of regionally specific structural changes in TS that are highly consistent with the hallmark symptoms associated with TS.},

	abstract = {Human functional MRI studies frequently reveal the joint activation of parietal and of lateral and mesial frontal areas during various cognitive tasks. To analyze the geometrical organization of those networks, we used an automatized clustering algorithm that parcels out sets of areas based on their similar profile of task-related activations or deactivations. This algorithm allowed us to reanalyze published fMRI data (Simon, O., Mangin, J.F., Cohen, L., Le Bihan, D., Dehaene, S., 2002. Topographical layout of hand, eye, calculation, and language-related areas in the human parietal lobe. Neuron 33, 475-487) and to reproduce the previously observed geometrical organization of activations for saccades, attention, grasping, pointing, calculation, and language processing in the parietal lobe. Further, we show that this organization extends to lateral and mesial prefrontal regions. Relative to the parietal lobe, the prefrontal functional geometry is characterized by a partially symmetrical anteroposterior ordering of activations, a decreased representation of effector-specific tasks, and a greater emphasis on higher cognitive functions of attention, higher-order spatial representation, calculation, and language. Anatomically, our results in humans are closely homologous to the known connectivity of parietal and frontal regions in the macaque monkey.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), water diffusion changes suggestive of microstructural tissue alterations have been recently reported in abnormal- and normal-appearing white matter as seen on T2-weighted images. In the subcortical gray matter, typical lacunar infarcts are repeatedly observed. Whether microstructural tissue changes are also present outside these lesions within the putamen or thalamus remains unknown. METHODS: We used diffusion tensor imaging, an MRI method highly sensitive to cerebral microstructure, in 20 CADASIL patients and 12 controls. Both the trace of the diffusion tensor [Tr(D)] and an anisotropic diffusion index (volume ratio) of diffusion were measured within the putamen and thalamus outside typical lacunar infarcts as detected on both T1- and T2-weighted images. RESULTS: A significant increase in Tr(D) and a decrease in anisotropy were observed in the putamen and thalamus in patients. The right/left indices of Tr(D) in the thalamus, but not in the putamen, were strongly correlated with the corresponding indices calculated in the white matter of the centrum semiovale. In addition, the diffusion increase in the thalamus was positively correlated with Tr(D) and with the load of small deep infarcts within the white matter and negatively correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that microstructural tissue alterations are present in the putamen and thalamus, outside the typical lacunar infarcts in CADASIL. In the thalamus, these microstructural changes appear constant and are even observed in asymptomatic subjects. Some of these thalamic changes appear to result from degeneration of thalamocortical pathways secondary to ischemic white matter damage. The importance of this degenerative phenomenon in the pathophysiology of CADASIL requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {In this study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether visual mental images retinotopically activate early visual cortex. Six participants were instructed to visualize or view horizontally or vertically oriented flashing bow-tie shaped stimuli. When compared to baseline, imagery globally activated Area V1. When the activation evoked by the stimuli at the different orientations was directly compared, distinct spatial activation patterns were obtained for each orientation in most participants. Not only was the topography of the activation patterns from imagery similar to the topography obtained with a corresponding visual perception task, but it closely matched the individual cortical representation of either the horizontal or the vertical visual field meridians. These findings strongly support that visual imagery and perception share low-level anatomical substrate and functional processes. Binding of spatial features is suggested as one possible mechanism.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of numerical representation suggest that understanding of numerical quantities is driven by a magnitude representation associated with the intraparietal sulcus and possibly under genetic control. The aim of this study was to investigate, using fMRI and structural imaging, the interaction between the abnormal development of numerical representation in an X-linked condition, Turner syndrome (TS), and the development of the intraparietal sulcus. fMRI during exact and approximate calculation in TS showed an abnormal modulation of intraparietal activations as a function of number size. Morphological analysis revealed an abnormal length, depth, and sulcal geometry of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting an important disorganization of this region in TS. Thus, a genetic form of developmental dyscalculia can be related to both functional and structural anomalies of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting a crucial role of this region in the development of arithmetic abilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing surgical resection of medial frontal lesions may present transient postoperative speech disorders that remain largely unpredictable. OBJECTIVE: To relate the occurrence of this speech deficit to the specific surgical lesion of the supplementary motor area (SMA) involved during language tasks using fMRI. METHODS: Twelve patients were studied using a verbal fluency task before resection of a low-grade glioma of the medial frontal lobe and compared with six healthy subjects. Pre- and postoperative MR variables including the hemispheric dominance for language, the extent of SMA removal, and the volume of resection were compared to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Following surgery, 6 of 12 patients presented speech disorders. The deficit was similar across patients, consisting of a global reduction in spontaneous speech, ranging from a complete mutism to a less severe speech reduction, which recovered within a few weeks or months. The occurrence of the deficit was related to the resection of the activation in the SMA of the dominant hemisphere for language (p {\textless} 0.01). Increased activation in the SMA of the healthy hemisphere on the preoperative fMRI was observed in patients with postoperative speech deficit. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI is able to identify the area at risk in the SMA, of which resection is related to the occurrence of characteristic transient postoperative speech disorders. Increased SMA activation in the healthy hemisphere suggested that a plastic change of SMA function occurred in these patients.},

Using event-related fMRI and high-density ERPs, we isolated cerebral areas where activation was influenced by input notation (verbal or Arabic notation). The bilateral extrastriate cortices and a left precentral region were more activated during verbal than during Arabic stimulation, while the right fusiform gyrus and a set of bilateral inferoparietal and frontal regions were more activated during Arabic than during verbal stimulation. We also identified areas that were influenced solely by the semantic content of the stimuli (numerical distance between numbers to be compared) independent of the input notation. Activation tightly correlated with numerical distance was observed mainly in a group of parietal areas distributed bilaterally along the intraparietal sulci and in the precuneus, as well as in the left middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate. Our results support the assumption of a central semantic representation of numerical quantity that relies on a common parietal network shared among notations.},

CSM retains the flexibility of the General Linear Model based estimation, but the procedures involved are adapted to operate on the cortical surface, while avoiding to resort to explicit flattening.

The results are compared with those obtained with a standard, volume-oriented approach (SPM), and it is shown that CSM leads to local differences in sensitivity, with generally higher sensitivity for CSM in two of the three subjects studied. The discussion provided is focused on the benefits of the introduction of anatomical information in fMRI data analysis, and the relevance of CSM as a step toward this goal.},

	volume = {30},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	issn = {0039-2499 (Print)},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CADASIL is a newly recognized cause of subcortical ischemic strokes that progressively leads to dementia associated with pseudobulbar palsy and severe motor disability. This deleterious progression and the severity of clinical presentation are widely variable among affected subjects. The exact role played by MRI white-matter abnormalities, a hallmark of the disease, in the severity of the clinical phenotype remains poorly understood. METHODS: To address this issue, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a new MRI technique highly sensitive to white-matter microstructural changes, in 16 symptomatic patients and 10 age-matched controls. Mean diffusivity and anisotropy of diffusion were measured within hyperintensities identified on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and outside these lesions on 4 slices at the level of centrum semiovale. RESULTS: We found a 60\% increase of water mean diffusivity and a parallel loss of diffusion anisotropy in hyperintensities identified on T2WI. The same pattern of diffusion changes, but of lesser intensity, was found in the normal-appearing white matter on T2WI. Mean diffusivity in regions with increased signal on T2WI was higher in patients with severe clinical disability compared with those with no or mild deficit (1.33+/-0.11 versus 1.13+/-0.11 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P{\textless}0.01). Furthermore, diffusion measured within T2 hyperintensities correlated with both the Mini-Mental State Examination and Rankin scale scores. In patients with a severe clinical status, the increase of water diffusion in these regions exceeded 70\% in comparison with values obtained in the normal white matter in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DTI is able to detect important ultrastructural changes in regions with increased signal on T2WI and within the normal-appearing white matter in CADASIL. The diffusion changes might be related to both neuronal loss and demyelination. The degree of the underlying ultrastructural alterations is related to the severity of the clinical status with a possible threshold level of white-matter damage above which severe neurological impairment may occur in this disease. DTI appears to be a promising technique for monitoring disease progression in CADASIL.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging has proved to be suitable and efficient for in vivo investigation of the early process of brain gyrification in fetuses and preterm newborns but the question remains as to whether cortical-related measurements derived from both cases are comparable or not. Indeed, the developmental folding trajectories drawn up from both populations have not been compared so far, neither from cross-sectional nor from longitudinal datasets. The present study aimed to compare features of cortical folding between healthy fetuses and early imaged preterm newborns on a cross-sectional basis, over a developmental period critical for the folding process (21-36 weeks of gestational age [GA]). A particular attention was carried out to reduce the methodological biases between the 2 populations. To provide an accurate group comparison, several global parameters characterizing the cortical morphometry were derived. In both groups, those metrics provided good proxies for the dramatic brain growth and cortical folding over this developmental period. Except for the cortical volume and the rate of sulci appearance, they depicted different trajectories in both groups suggesting that the transition from into ex utero has a visible impact on cortical morphology that is at least dependent on the GA at birth in preterm newborns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT study) was designed to assess the efficacy of isolated supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid, an isolated multidomain intervention (consisting of nutritional counseling, physical exercise, cognitive stimulation) or a combination of the two interventions on the change of cognitive functions in frail subjects aged 70 years and older for a period of 3 years. Ancillary neuroimaging studies were additionally implemented to evaluate the impact of interventions on cerebral metabolism (FDG PET scans) and atrophy rate (MRIs), as well as brain amyloïd deposit (AV45 PET scans).
DESIGN PATIENTS:
1680 subjects (mean age: 75.3 years; female: 64.8 \%), enrolled by 13 memory clinics, were randomized into one of the following four groups: omega-3 supplementation alone, multidomain intervention alone, omega-3 plus multidomain intervention, or placebo. Participants underwent cognitive, functional and biological assessments at M6, M12, M24 and M36 visits. The primary endpoint is a change of memory function at 3 years, as assessed by the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test. All participants will be followed for 2 additional years after the 3-years intervention (MAPT PLUS extension study).
INTERVENTIONS:
1/Omega-3 supplementation: two soft capsules daily as a single dose, containing a total of 400 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), i.e., 800 mg docosahexaenoic acid per day, for 3 years. 2/ Multidomain intervention: collective training sessions conducted in small groups (6-8 participants) in twelve 120-minute sessions over the first 2 months (two sessions a week for the first month, and one session a week the second month) then a 60-minute session per month in the following three areas: nutrition, physical activity, and cognition until the end of the 3 years. In addition to the collective sessions, individualized preventive outpatient visits exploring possible risk factors for cognitive decline are performed at baseline, M12 and M24.
BASELINE POPULATION:
For cognition, the mean MMSE at baseline was 28.1 (± 1.6). About 58\% and 42\% of participants had a CDR score equal to 0 and 0.5, respectively. Regarding mobility status, 200 (11.9\%) had a 4-m gait speed lower or equal to 0.8 m/s. According to the Fried criteria, 673 (42.1\%) participants were considered pre frail, and 51 (3.2\%) frail. The red blood cell DHA content was 26.1 ± 8.1 µg/g. Five hundred and three participants underwent baseline MRI. AV45 PET scans were performed in 271 individuals and preliminary results showed that 38.0\% had a cortical SUVR {\textgreater} 1.17, which gave an indication of significant brain amyloïd deposit. DISCUSSION: The MAPT trial is presently the first largest and longest multidomain preventive trial relevant to cognitive decline in older adults with subjective memory complaints. The multidomain intervention designed for the MAPT trial is likely to be easily implemented within the general population.},

	abstract = {Both language capacity and strongly lateralized hand preference are among the most intriguing particularities of the human species. They are associated in the adult brain with functional and anatomical hemispheric asymmetries in the speech perception-production network and in the sensori-motor system. Only studies in early life can help us to understand how such asymmetries arise during brain development, and to which point structural left-right differences are the source or the consequence of functional lateralization. In this study, we aimed to provide new in vivo structural markers of hemispheric asymmetries in infants from 1 to 4 months of age, with diffusion tensor imaging. We used 3 complementary analysis methods based on local diffusion indices and spatial localizations of tracts. After a prospective approach over the whole brain, we demonstrated early leftward asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus and in the cortico-spinal tract. These results suggest that the early macroscopic geometry, microscopic organization, and maturation of these white matter bundles are related to the development of later functional lateralization.},

	abstract = {Many recent single-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging reconstruction techniques have been introduced to reconstruct orientation distribution functions (ODF) that only capture angular information contained in the diffusion process of water molecules. By also considering the radial part of the diffusion signal, the reconstruction of the ensemble average diffusion propagator (EAP) of water molecules can provide much richer information about complex tissue microstructure than the ODF. In this paper, we present diffusion propagator imaging (DPI), a novel technique to reconstruct the EAP from multiple shell acquisitions. The DPI solution is analytical and linear because it is based on a Laplace equation modeling of the diffusion signal. DPI is validated with ex vivo phantoms and also illustrated on an in vivo human brain dataset. DPI is shown to reconstruct EAP from only two b-value shells and approximately 100 diffusion measurements.},

	abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has become an established research tool for the investigation of tissue structure and orientation. In this paper, we present a method for real-time processing of diffusion tensor and Q-ball imaging. The basic idea is to use Kalman filtering framework to fit either the linear tensor or Q-ball model. Because the Kalman filter is designed to be an incremental algorithm, it naturally enables updating the model estimate after the acquisition of any new diffusion-weighted volume. Processing diffusion models and maps during ongoing scans provides a new useful tool for clinicians, especially when it is not possible to predict how long a subject may remain still in the magnet. First, we introduce the general linear models corresponding to the two diffusion tensor and analytical Q-ball models of interest. Then, we present the Kalman filtering framework and we focus on the optimization of the diffusion orientation sets in order to speed up the convergence of the online processing. Last, we give some results on a healthy volunteer for the online tensor and the Q-ball model, and we make some comparisons with the conventional offline techniques used in the literature. We could achieve full real-time for diffusion tensor imaging and deferred time for Q-ball imaging, using a single workstation.},

The phantoms were made of small-diameter acrylic fibers, chosen for their high hydrophobicity and flexibility that ensured good control of the phantom geometry. The polyurethane medium was filled under vacuum with an aqueous solution that was previously degassed, doped with gadolinium-tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA), and treated by ultrasonic waves. Two versions of such phantoms were manufactured and tested. The phantom's applicability was demonstrated on an analytical Q-ball model. Numerical simulations were performed to assess the accuracy of the phantom. The phantom data will be made accessible to the community with the objective of analyzing various HARDI models.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressing non-linear dynamic brain disease in which pathophysiological abnormalities, detectable in vivo by biological markers, precede overt clinical symptoms by many years to decades. Use of these biomarkers for the detection of early and preclinical AD has become of central importance following publication of two international expert working group's revised criteria for the diagnosis of AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, prodromal AD and preclinical AD. As a consequence of matured research evidence six AD biomarkers are sufficiently validated and partly qualified to be incorporated into operationalized clinical diagnostic criteria and use in primary and secondary prevention trials. These biomarkers fall into two molecular categories: biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and plaque formation as well as of tau-protein related hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Three of the six gold-standard ("core feasible) biomarkers are neuroimaging measures and three are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes. CSF Aβ1-42 (Aβ1-42), also expressed as Aβ1-42 : Aβ1-40 ratio, T-tau, and P-tau Thr181 \& Thr231 proteins have proven diagnostic accuracy and risk enhancement in prodromal MCI and AD dementia. Conversely, having all three biomarkers in the normal range rules out AD. Intermediate conditions require further patient follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at increasing field strength and resolution allows detecting the evolution of distinct types of structural and functional abnormality pattern throughout early to late AD stages. Anatomical or volumetric MRI is the most widely used technique and provides local and global measures of atrophy. The revised diagnostic criteria for "prodromal AD" and "mild cognitive impairment due to AD" include hippocampal atrophy (as the fourth validated biomarker), which is considered an indicator of regional neuronal injury. Advanced image analysis techniques generate automatic and reproducible measures both in regions of interest, such as the hippocampus and in an exploratory fashion, observer and hypothesis-indedendent, throughout the entire brain. Evolving modalities such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced tractography as well as resting-state functional MRI provide useful additionally useful measures indicating the degree of fiber tract and neural network disintegration (structural, effective and functional connectivity) that may substantially contribute to early detection and the mapping of progression. These modalities require further standardization and validation. The use of molecular in vivo amyloid imaging agents (the fifth validated biomarker), such as the Pittsburgh Compound-B and markers of neurodegeneration, such as fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) (as the sixth validated biomarker) support the detection of early AD pathological processes and associated neurodegeneration. How to use, interpret, and disclose biomarker results drives the need for optimized standardization. Multimodal AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping fashion. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time. AD biomarkers can be combined to increase accuracy or risk. A list of genetic risk factors is increasingly included in secondary prevention trials to stratify and select individuals at genetic risk of AD. Although most of these biomarker candidates are not yet qualified and approved by regulatory authorities for their intended use in drug trials, they are nonetheless applied in ongoing clinical studies for the following functions: (i) inclusion/exclusion criteria, (ii) patient stratification, (iii) evaluation of treatment effect, (iv) drug target engagement, and (v) safety. Moreover, novel promising hypothesis-driven, as well as exploratory biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging markers for use in clinical trials are being developed. The current state-of-the-art and future perspectives on both biological and neuroimaging derived biomarker discovery and development as well as the intended application in prevention trials is outlined in the present publication.},

The method is based on a multi-subject bundle atlas derived from a two-level intra-subject and inter-subject clustering strategy. This atlas is a model of the brain white matter organization, computed for a group of subjects, made up of a set of generic fiber bundles that can be detected in most of the population. Each atlas bundle corresponds to several inter-subject clusters manually labeled to account for subdivisions of the underlying pathways often presenting large variability across subjects. An atlas bundle is represented by the multi-subject list of the centroids of all intra-subject clusters in order to get a good sampling of the shape and localization variability. The atlas, composed of 36 known deep white matter bundles and 47 superficial white matter bundles in each hemisphere, was inferred from a first database of 12 brains. It was successfully used to segment the deep white matter bundles in a second database of 20 brains and most of the superficial white matter bundles in 10 subjects of the same database.},

Thanks to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is now possible to image the baby's immature brain and to consider subtle correlations between the brain anatomical development and the early acquisition of cognitive functions. Dedicated methodologies for image acquisition and post-treatment must then be used because the size of cerebral structures and the image contrast are very different in comparison with the adult brain, and because the examination length is a major constraint. Two recent studies have evaluated the developing brain under an original perspective. The first one has focused on cortical folding in preterm newborns, from 6 to 8 months of gestational age, assessed with T2-weighted conventional MRI. The second study has mapped the organization and maturation of white matter fiber bundles in 1- to 4-month-old healthy infants with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both studies have enabled to highlight spatio-temporal differences in the brain regions' maturation, as well as early anatomical asymmetries between cerebral hemispheres. These studies emphasize the potential of MRI to evaluate brain development compared with the infant's psychomotor acquisitions after birth.},

This work is a natural surface-based extension of the volume-based structural approach presented in a previous paper. A multi-scale surface-based representation of individual activation maps is first computed for each subject. Then the inter-subject matching and the activation detection decision are performed jointly by optimization of a Markovian model. Finally, a significance measure is computed in a non-parametric way for the results, in order to assess their relevance and control the risk of type I error. The method is applied on simulated and real data and the results are compared to those produced by standard analyses. The surface-based structural analysis is shown to be particularly robust to inter-subject spatial variability and to produce relevant results with good specificity and sensitivity. We also demonstrate the advantages of the surface-based approach by comparing with the results of a 3D structural analysis.},

Currents provides a distance between geometric structures that can be defined without specifying explicit point-to-point correspondences. We demonstrate this framework by registering simultaneously T1 images and 65 fiber bundles consistently extracted in 12 subjects and compare it against non-linear T1, tensor, and multi-modal T1 + Fractional Anisotropy (FA) registration algorithms.

For instance, handedness has an impact on central sulcus surface area: the sulcus is larger in the dominant left hemisphere of dextrals and vice versa for sinistrals. However, the impact of handedness on the shape of the central sulcus is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose first an original strategy based on manifold learning to quantify the shape of the central sulcus. Using this approach we show that the "hand knob", a major landmark of the hand motor representation, is sited more dorsally in the left hemisphere in dextrals than in sinistrals. Sinistrals forced to write with their non-preferred right hand display a pattern of central sulcus size asymmetry which is typical of dextrals, yet forced dextrality does not shift the handedness-specific location of the "hand knob". Hence, cortical morphology in adults holds an accumulated record of both innate biases and early developmental experience. Characterizing normal variation of cortical morphology provides a means of systematically correlating behavior with cortical development.},

Here, we used a software program (BrainVISA) to quantify asymmetries in cortical depth and surface area from magnetic resonance images in a sample of 127 chimpanzees and 49 macaques. Population brain asymmetries were determined from 11 sulci in chimpanzees and seven sulci in macaques. Sulci were taken from the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Population-level asymmetries were evident in chimpanzees for several sulci, including the fronto-orbital, superior precentral, and sylvian fissure sulci. The macaque population did not reveal significant population-level asymmetries, except for surface area of the superior temporal sulcus. The overall results are discussed within the context of the evolution of higher order cognition and motor functions.},

The present study assesses the relationships between encoding versus retrieval deficits in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and atrophy specifically within the hippocampus and throughout the white matter. Twenty-two aMCI patients underwent T1-weighted MRI scans and neuropsychological testing. Grey matter and white matter segments obtained from the MRI images were each entered in correlation analyses, assessed only in the hippocampus for grey matter segments, with encoding and retrieval memory performances. For the grey matter segments, the resulting spmT correlation maps were then superimposed onto a 3D surface view of the hippocampus to identify the relative involvement of the different subfields, a method already used and validated elsewhere. Memory encoding deficits specifically correlated with CA1 subfield atrophy, while no relationship was found with white matter atrophy. In contrast, retrieval deficits were weakly related to hippocampal atrophy and did not involve a particular subfield, while they strongly correlated with loss of white matter, specifically in medial parietal and frontal areas. In aMCI patients, encoding impairment appears specifically related to atrophy of the CA1 hippocampal subfield, consistent with the predominance of encoding deficits and CA1 atrophy in aMCI. In contrast, episodic retrieval deficits seem to be underlain by more distributed tissue losses, consistent with a disruption of a hippocampo-parieto-frontal network.},

Results Delineation of the subdural grid within LGP in a patient with seizures caused by left parietal glioma permitted a detailed assessment of the location of electrodes relative to the cortical gyri and sulci and significantly facilitated interpretation of brain mapping before tumor resection. In another patient with parieto-occipital glioma, simultaneous three-dimensional visualization of the tumor, CST, and optic radiation with the use of LGP permitted us to perform tumor resection without postoperative neurologic complications.

In this multimodal MR imaging study, we used 2 voxel-based analysis methods to assess the voxelwise relationship of magnetization transfer ratio and white matter hyperintensity location with gait velocity in older adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 230 community-dwelling participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study. Every participant underwent 3T MR imaging, including magnetization transfer imaging. Voxel-based magnetization transfer ratio-symptom mapping correlated the white matter magnetization transfer ratio of each voxel with gait velocity. To assess a possible relationship between white matter hyperintensity location and gait velocity, we applied voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping.
RESULTS: We found a significant association between the magnetization transfer ratio within the forceps minor and gait velocity (β = 0.134; 95\% CI, 0.011-0.258; P = .033), independent of demographics, general physical performance, vascular risk factors, and brain volume. White matter hyperintensities did not significantly change this association.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new evidence for the importance of magnetization transfer ratio changes in gait disturbances at an older age, particularly in the forceps minor. The histopathologic basis of these findings is yet to be determined.},

Its neurodevelopment and relationship with the social impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are not well understood. We explored the relationship between social cognition and the neurodevelopment of the pSTS in ASD.
METHOD: We included 44 adults with high-functioning ASD and 36 controls. We assessed their performances on the 'Reading the mind in the eyes' test (for 34 of 44 subjects with ASD and 30 of 36 controls), their fixation time on the eyes with eye tracking (for 35 of 44 subjects with ASD and 30 of 36 controls) and the morphology of the caudal branches of the pSTS (length and depth), markers of the neurodevelopment, with structural MRI.
RESULTS: The right anterior caudal ramus of the pSTS was significantly longer in patients with ASD compared with controls (52.6 mm vs. 38.3 mm; P = 1.4 × 10-3 ; Cohen's d = 0.76). Its length negatively correlated with fixation time on the eyes (P = 0.03) in the ASD group and with the 'Reading the mind in the eyes' test scores in both groups (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the neurodevelopment of the pSTS is related to the ASD social impairments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) with decline in lower extremity function (LEF) over approximately 3 years in dementia-free older adults with memory complaints.
METHODS: We obtained brain MRI data from 458 community-dwelling adults, aged 70 years or over, at baseline, and from 358 adults over an average follow-up of 963 days. We evaluated LEF using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). We related baseline WMH volumes and progression to SPPB scores over time, using mixed-effect linear regressions. For the secondary analyses, we categorized baseline WMH volume into quartiles, and dichotomized the WMH progression to compare fast and slow progression.
RESULTS: Baseline WMH volume (β = -0.017, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.025 to -0.009), as well as WMH progression (β = -0.002, 95\% CI -0.003 to -0.001), significantly associated with a decline in SPPB performance in adjusted analyses. Compared with the lowest quartile of baseline WMH volume, the highest quartile associated with a decline in SPPB performance (β = -0.301, 95\% CI -0.558 to -0.044). Fast progression also associated with a decline in SPPB performance. We found clinically meaningful differences in the SPPB, with higher scores in participants with slow progression of WMH, at both 24 and 36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline level and WMH progression associated with longitudinal decline in SPPB performance among older adults. We detected clinically meaningful differences in SPPB performance on comparing fast with slow progression of WMH, suggesting that speed of WMH progression is an important determinant of LEF during aging.},

	abstract = {A basic issue in neurosciences is to look for possible relationships between brain architecture and cognitive models. The lack of architectural information in magnetic resonance images, however, has led the neuroimaging community to develop brain mapping strategies based on various coordinate systems without accurate architectural content. Therefore, the relationships between architectural and functional brain organizations are difficult to study when analyzing neuroimaging experiments. This paper advocates that the design of new brain image analysis methods inspired by the structural strategies often used in computer vision may provide better ways to address these relationships. The key point underlying this new framework is the conversion of the raw images into structural representations before analysis. These representations are made up of data-driven elementary features like activated clusters, cortical folds or fiber bundles. Two classes of methods are introduced. Inference of structural models via matching across a set of individuals is described first. This inference problem is illustrated by the group analysis of functional statistical parametric maps (SPMs). Then, the matching of new individual data with a priori known structural models is described, using the recognition of the cortical sulci as a prototypical example.},

The study was carried out in eight healthy human volunteers using as a tracer [11C]-physostigmine ([11C]PHY), an inhibitor of AChE. After intravenous injection of [11C]PHY, radioactivity was rapidly taken up in brain tissue and reached maximal uptake within a few minutes, following a regional pattern mostly related to cerebral perfusion. After the peak, the cerebral radioactivity gradually decreased with a half-life varying from 20 to 35 min, depending on the brain structure. [11C] PHY retention was higher in regions rich in AChE, such as the striatum (half-life, 35 min), than in regions poor in AChE, such as the cerebral cortex (half-life, 20 min). At later times (25-35 min postinjection), the cerebral distribution of [11C]PHY was typical of AChE activity: putamen-caudate {\textgreater} cerebellum {\textgreater} brainstem {\textgreater} thalamus {\textgreater} cerebral cortex, with a striatal to cortex ratio of 2. These results suggest that PET studies with [11C]PHY can provide in vivo brain mapping of human AChE and are promising for the study of changes in AChE levels associated with neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Dissecting neural circuitry in non-human primates (NHP) is crucial to identify potential neuromodulation anatomical targets for the treatment of pharmacoresistant neuropsychiatric diseases by electrical neuromodulation. How targets of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cortical targets of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) compare and might complement one another is an important question. Combining optogenetics and tractography may enable anatomo-functional characterization of large brain cortico-subcortical neural pathways. For the proof-of-concept this approach was used in the NHP brain to characterize the motor cortico-subthalamic pathway (m\_CSP) which might be involved in DBS action mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Rabies-G-pseudotyped and Rabies-G-VSVg-pseudotyped EIAV lentiviral vectors encoding the opsin ChR2 gene were stereotaxically injected into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and were retrogradely transported to the layer of the motor cortex projecting to STN. A precise anatomical mapping of this pathway was then performed using histology-guided high angular resolution MRI tractography guiding accurately cortical photostimulation of m\_CSP origins. Photoexcitation of m\_CSP axon terminals or m\_CSP cortical origins modified the spikes distribution for photosensitive STN neurons firing rate in non-equivalent ways. Optogenetic tractography might help design preclinical neuromodulation studies in NHP models of neuropsychiatric disease choosing the most appropriate target for the tested hypothesis.},

A partial clustering algorithm using bootstrap sampling and bagging (PCBB) is devised for cortical pattern mining. Partial clusters are found using a modified hierarchical clustering method constrained by an objective function which looks for the most compact and dissimilar clusters. Bagging is used to increase stability. Experiments on simulated and real datasets are used to demonstrate the strength and stability of this algorithm compared to other standard approaches. Some cortical patterns are found using our method. In particular, the patterns found for the left cingulate sulcus are consistent with the patterns described in the atlas of Ono.},

	abstract = {Brain imaging research in schizophrenia has provided a better understanding of the neural basis of auditory hallucinations (AH). Recently, renewed interest in the phenomenology of AH raised questions related to their neural substrates. Hence, the neural basis of AH self/other attribution have yet to be investigated as beliefs regarding the origin of the voices is a cardinal feature of AH phenomenology. As the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) play a key role in disentangling the origin of sensory events and in self/other distinction, we tested the hypothesis that the morphology of the IPL/TPJ area may be involved in AH self/other attribution. Magnetic resonance images of 39 right-handed patients with persistent auditory hallucinations and 19 healthy subjects were analyzed with sulcus-based morphometry. AH self-other attribution were found to be associated with the sulcal pattern of the posterior part of the Sylvian fissure, encompassing the IPL/TPJ area. The preference for the attribution of AH to self or to others could be associated with early neurodevelopmental events as the sulcal pattern is determined during fetal life and is stable after birth. Our study also raises basic cognitive questions regarding self-consciousness and suggest that impairments at a pre-reflexive level, leading to hearing his/her thoughts as voices ('I' level or feeling of agency), and a reflexive level leading to attribution belief ('Me' level or judgment of agency) are likely involved in AH.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of cortical folding may provide insight into neurodevelopment deviations, which, in turn, can predispose to depression that responds particularly poorly to medications. We hypothesized that patients with treatment-resistant depression would exhibit measurable alterations in cortical folding.
METHODS: We computed hemispheric global sulcal indices (g-SIs) in T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained from 76 patients and 70 healthy controls. We separately searched for anatomic deviations in patients with bipolar disorder (16 patients with treatment-resistant depression, 25 with euthymia) and unipolar depression (35 patients with treatment-resistant depression).
RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both groups of patients with treatment-resistant depression exhibited reduced g-SIs: in the right hemisphere among patients with bipolar disorder and in both hemispheres among those with unipolar depression. Patients with euthymic bipolar disorder did not differ significantly from depressed patients or healthy controls. Among patients with bipolar disorder who were taking lithium, we found positive correlations between current lithium dose and g-SIs in both hemispheres.
LIMITATIONS: We cannot estimate the extent to which the observed g-SI reductions are linked to treatment resistance and to what extent they are state-dependent. Furthermore, we cannot disentangle the impact of medications from that of the affective disorder. Finally, there is interindividual variation and overlap of g-SIs among patients and healthy controls that need to be considered when interpreting our results.
CONCLUSION: Reduced global cortical folding surface appears to be characteristic of patients with treatment-resistant depression, either unipolar or bipolar. In patients with bipolar disorder, treatment with lithium may modify cortical folding surface.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebral abnormalities have been detected in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In comparison to BD with a later onset, early-onset BD has been found to have a poorer outcome. However, it is yet unknown whether neuroanatomical abnormalities differ between age-at-onset subgroups of the illness. We searched for cortical folding differences between early-onset (before 25 years) and intermediate-onset (between 25 and 45 years) BD patients.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 22 early-onset BD patients, 14 intermediate-onset BD patients, and 50 healthy participants were analyzed using a fully automated method to extract, label, and measure the sulcal area in the whole cortex. Cortical folding was assessed by computing global sulcal indices (the ratio between total sulcal area and total outer cortex area) for each hemisphere, and local sulcal indices for 12 predefined regions in both hemispheres.
RESULTS: Intermediate-onset BD patients had a significantly reduced local sulcal index in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in comparison to both early-onset BD patients and healthy subjects, and lower global sulcal indices in both hemispheres in comparison to healthy subjects (p {\textless} 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Brain tissue volumes did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first evidence of a neuroanatomic difference between intermediate-onset and early-onset BD, which lends further support to the existence of different age-at-onset subgroups of BD.},

Sixty-six biologically confirmed AD patients (positive amyloid positron emission tomography [PET] and/or AD cerebrospinal fluid profile) were contrasted to 35 controls with negative amyloid PET. Patients were classified into prodromal or dementia stages as well as into late onset (LOAD, n = 31) or early onset (EOAD, n = 35) subgroups according to their age of onset. An automated method was used to calculate sulcal widths and hippocampal volumes (HV). In EOAD, the greatest ability to differentiate patients from age-matched controls, regardless of severity, was displayed by sulcal width of the temporoparietal cortex. In this region, diagnosis accuracy was better than the HV, especially at prodromal stage. In LOAD, HV provided the best discrimination power from age-matched controls. In conclusion, sulcal width measures are better markers than the HV for identifying prodromal AD in patients aged {\textless}65 years. In contrast, in older patients, the risk of over-diagnosis from using only sulcal enlargement is important.},

	abstract = {Normal cognitive development in infants follows a well-known temporal sequence, which is assumed to be correlated with the structural maturation of underlying functional networks. Postmortem studies and, more recently, structural MR imaging studies have described qualitatively the heterogeneous spatiotemporal progression of white matter myelination. However, in vivo quantification of the maturation phases of fiber bundles is still lacking. We used noninvasive diffusion tensor MR imaging and tractography in twenty-three 1-4-month-old healthy infants to quantify the early maturation of the main cerebral fascicles. A specific maturation model, based on the respective roles of different maturational processes on the diffusion phenomena, was designed to highlight asynchronous maturation across bundles by evaluating the time-course of mean diffusivity and anisotropy changes over the considered developmental period. Using an original approach, a progression of maturation in four relative stages was determined in each tract by estimating the maturation state and speed, from the diffusion indices over the infants group compared with an adults group on one hand, and in each tract compared with the average over bundles on the other hand. Results were coherent with, and extended previous findings in 8 of 11 bundles, showing the anterior limb of the internal capsule and cingulum as the most immature, followed by the optic radiations, arcuate and inferior longitudinal fascicles, then the spinothalamic tract and fornix, and finally the corticospinal tract as the most mature bundle. Thus, this approach provides new quantitative landmarks for further noninvasive research on brain-behavior relationships during normal and abnormal development.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Tractography studies investigating white matter (WM) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder have yielded heterogeneous results owing to small sample sizes. The small size limits their generalizability, a critical issue for neuroimaging studies of biomarkers of bipolar I disorder (BPI).
OBJECTIVES: To study WM abnormalities using whole-brain tractography in a large international multicenter sample of BPI patients and to compare these alterations between patients with or without a history of psychotic features during mood episodes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, multicenter, international, Q-ball imaging tractography study comparing 118 BPI patients and 86 healthy control individuals. In addition, among the patient group, we compared those with and without a history of psychotic features. University hospitals in France, Germany, and the United States contributed participants.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent assessment using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies at the French sites or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV at the German and US sites. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired using the same acquisition parameters and scanning hardware at each site. We reconstructed 22 known deep WM tracts using Q-ball imaging tractography and an automatized segmentation technique.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized fractional anisotropy values along each reconstructed WM tract.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, BPI patients had significant reductions in mean generalized fractional anisotropy values along the body and the splenium of the corpus callosum, the left cingulum, and the anterior part of the left arcuate fasciculus when controlling for age, sex, and acquisition site (corrected for multiple testing). Patients with a history of psychotic features had a lower mean generalized fractional anisotropy value than those without along the body of the corpus callosum (corrected for multiple testing).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter sample, BPI patients had reduced WM integrity in interhemispheric, limbic, and arcuate WM tracts. Interhemispheric pathways are more disrupted in patients with than in those without psychotic symptoms. Together these results highlight the existence of an anatomic disconnectivity in BPI and further underscore a role for interhemispheric disconnectivity in the pathophysiological features of psychosis in BPI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history and disease mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are still poorly understood. Very few resources are available to scrutinise patients as early as needed and to use integrative approaches combining standardised, repeated clinical investigations and cutting-edge biomarker measurements.
METHODS: In the nationwide French MEMENTO cohort study, participants were recruited in memory clinics and screened for either isolated subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; defined as test performance 1.5 SD below age, sex and education-level norms) while not demented (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] {\textless}1). Baseline data collection included neurological and physical examinations as well as extensive neuropsychological testing. To be included in the MEMENTO cohort, participants had to agree to undergo both brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sampling. Cerebral 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positon emission tomography and lumbar puncture were optional. Automated analyses of cerebral MRI included assessments of volumes of whole-brain, hippocampal and white matter lesions.
RESULTS: The 2323 participants, recruited from April 2011 to June 2014, were aged 71 years, on average (SD 8.7), and 62\% were women. CDR was 0 in 40\% of participants, and 30\% carried at least one apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. We observed that more than half (52\%) of participants had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (17\% single-domain aMCI), 32\% had non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (16.9\% single-domain naMCI) and 16\% had isolated SCCs. Multivariable analyses of neuroimaging markers associations with cognitive categories showed that participants with aMCI had worse levels of imaging biomarkers than the others, whereas participants with naMCI had markers at intermediate levels between SCC and aMCI. The burden of white matter lesions tended to be larger in participants with aMCI. Independently of CDR, all neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers worsened with age, whereas differences were not consistent according to sex.
CONCLUSIONS: MEMENTO is a large cohort with extensive clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data and represents a platform for studying the natural history of ADRD in a large group of participants with different subtypes of MCI (amnestic or not amnestic) or isolated SCCs.

Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of the pathogenesis associated to it. In this work we developed a method for the automatic creation of a SWM bundle multi-subject atlas. The atlas generation method is based on a cortical parcellation for the extraction of fibers connecting two different gyri. Then, an intra-subject fiber clustering is applied, in order to divide each bundle into sub-bundles with similar shape. After that, a two-step inter-subject fiber clustering is used in order to find the correspondence between the sub-bundles across the subjects, fuse similar clusters and discard the outliers. The method was applied to 40 subjects of a high quality HARDI database, focused on the left hemisphere fronto-parietal and insula brain regions. We obtained an atlas composed of 44 bundles connecting 22 pair of ROIs. Then the atlas was used to automatically segment 39 new subjects from the database.},

Such a reproducible localization is paradoxical, given that reading is a recent invention that could not have influenced the genetic evolution of the cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that the VWFA recycles a region of the ventral visual cortex that shows a high degree of anatomical connectivity to perisylvian language areas, thus providing an efficient circuit for both grapheme-phoneme conversion and lexical access. In two distinct experiments, using high-resolution diffusion-weighted data from 75 human subjects, we show that (1) the VWFA, compared with the fusiform face area, shows higher connectivity to left-hemispheric perisylvian superior temporal, anterior temporal and inferior frontal areas; (2) on a posterior-to-anterior axis, its localization within the left occipitotemporal sulcus maps onto a peak of connectivity with language areas, with slightly distinct subregions showing preferential projections to areas respectively involved in grapheme-phoneme conversion and lexical access. In agreement with functional data on the VWFA in blind subjects, the results suggest that connectivity to language areas, over and above visual factors, may be the primary determinant of VWFA localization.},

This study sought to assess the effects of rTMS on AVH, with a focus on hallucination phenomenology.
METHOD: Twenty-seven patients with schizophrenia and medication-resistant AVH participated to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on rTMS study. The stimulation targeted a language-perception area individually determined using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a language recognition task. AVH were assessed using the hallucination subscale of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS). The spatial location of AVH was assessed using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales.
RESULTS: A significant improvement in SAPS hallucination subscale score was observed in both actively treated and placebo-treated groups with no difference between both modalities. Patients with external AVH were significantly more improved than patients with internal AVH, with both modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: A marked placebo effect of rTMS was observed in patients with resistant AVH. Patients with prominent external AVH may be more likely to benefit from both active and placebo interventions. Cortical effects related to non-magnetic stimulation of the auditory cortex are suggested.},

Twenty-four 9-year-old children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (9 with fetal alcohol syndrome, 15 heavy exposed nonsyndromal children) and 16 age-matched controls were studied to assess the effect of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cortical morphology. An automated method was applied to 3D T1-weighted images to assess cortical gyrification using global and regional sulcal indices and two region-based morphological measurements, mean sulcal depth and fold opening. Increasing levels of alcohol exposure were related to reduced cortical folding complexity, even among children with normal brain size, indicating a reduction of buried cortical surface. Fold opening was the strongest anatomical correlate of prenatal alcohol intake, indicating a widening of sulci in all regions that were examined. These data identify cortical morphology as a suitable marker for further investigation of brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.},

	abstract = {Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yields noisy magnitude data, described in most cases as following a noncentral χ distribution when the signals received by the coils are combined as the sum of their squares. One well-known case of this noncentral χ noise model is the Rician model, but it is only valid in the case of single-channel acquisition. Although the use of parallel MRI is increasingly common, most of the correction methods still perform Rician noise removal, yielding an erroneous result due to an incorrect noise model. Moreover, the existence of noise correlations in phased array systems renders noise nonstationary and further modifies the noise description in parallel MRI. However, the noncentral χ model has been demonstrated to work as a good approximation as long as effective voxelwise parameters are used. A good correction step, adapted to the right noise model, is of paramount importance, especially when working with diffusion-weighted MR data, whose signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this paper, we present a noise removal technique designed to be fast enough for integration into a real-time reconstruction system, thus offering the convenience of obtaining corrected data almost instantaneously during the MRI scan. Our method employs the noncentral χ noise model and uses a simplified method to account for noise correlations; this leads to an efficient and rapid correction. The method consists of an anisotropic extension of the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (LMMSE) that is a far better edge-preserving method than the traditional LMMSE and addresses noncentral χ distributions along with empirically computed global effective parameters. The results on simulated and real data demonstrate that this anisotropic extended LMMSE outperforms the original LMMSE on images corrupted by noncentral χ noise. Moreover, in comparison with the existing LMMSE technique incorporating the estimation of voxelwise effective parameters, our method yields improved results.},

The main originality of the method is to compress for each gyrus the connectivity profiles used for the clustering without any anatomical prior information. This step takes into account the interindividual cortical and connectivity variability. To this end, we consider intersubject high density connectivity areas extracted using a surface-based watershed algorithm. A wide validation study has led to a fully automatic pipeline which is robust to variations in data preprocessing (tracking type, cortical mesh characteristics and boundaries of initial gyri), data characteristics (including number of subjects), and the main algorithmic parameters. A remarkable reproducibility is achieved in parcellation results for the whole cortex, leading to clear and stable cortical patterns. This reproducibility has been tested across non-overlapping subgroups and the validation is presented mainly on the pre- and postcentral gyri.},

	abstract = {In recent years, diffusion MRI has become an extremely important tool for studying the morphology of living brain tissue, as it provides unique insights into both its macrostructure and microstructure. Recent applications of diffusion MRI aimed to characterize the structural connectome using tractography to infer connectivity between brain regions. In parallel to the development of tractography, additional diffusion MRI based frameworks (CHARMED, AxCaliber, ActiveAx) were developed enabling the extraction of a multitude of micro-structural parameters (axon diameter distribution, mean axonal diameter and axonal density). This unique insight into both tissue microstructure and connectivity has enormous potential value in understanding the structure and organization of the brain as well as providing unique insights to abnormalities that underpin disease states. The CONNECT (Consortium Of Neuroimagers for the Non-invasive Exploration of brain Connectivity and Tracts) project aimed to combine tractography and micro-structural measures of the living human brain in order to obtain a better estimate of the connectome, while also striving to extend validation of these measurements. This paper summarizes the project and describes the perspective of using micro-structural measures to study the connectome.},

We present an automatic method to identify short bundles of the superficial white matter based on inter-subject hierarchical clustering. Our method finds clusters of similar fibers, belonging to the different subjects, according to a distance measure between fibers. First, the algorithm obtains representative bundles and subsequently we perform an automatic labeling based on the anatomy, of the most stable connections. The analysis was applied to two independent groups of 37 subjects. Results between the two groups were compared, in order to keep reproducible connections for the atlas creation. The method was applied using linear and non-linear registration, where the non-linear registration showed significantly better results. A final atlas with 35 bundles in the left hemisphere and 27 in the right hemisphere from the whole brain was obtained. Finally results were validated using the atlas to segment 26 new subjects from another HARDI database.},

The dataset we present here is a first step in this direction. It comprises 10 T2-weighted MRIs of healthy adult macaque brains, acquired on a 7 T magnet, along with corresponding manual segmentations into 17 brain anatomic labelled regions spread over 5 hierarchical levels based on a previously published macaque atlas (Calabrese et al., 2015) [1]. By giving access to this unique dataset, we hope to provide a reference needed by the non-human primate imaging community.

WMH volume was obtained by an automated segmentation algorithm. Baseline WMH volumes and change between baseline and follow-up WMH were related to cognitive scores over time using mixed-effect linear regressions. Secondary stratified analyses according to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) status, APOE4 status, and presence of amyloid in the brain were conducted using similar regression models. Change in WMH volume overtime was associated with declines in COWAT (β=-0.239; 95\% CI=-0.381, -0.096, p=0.001). Baseline WMH was not associated to any of the cognitive tests. Secondary analysis found that baseline WMH was associated to declines in TMT-A in APOE4 non-carriers (β=0.343; 95\% CI=0.121, 0.564, p=0.003) and CDR 0 groups (β=0.307; 95\% CI=0.095, 0.519, p=0.005); in CDR 0 group, overtime changes in WMH was associated to declines on both TMT-A (β=0.698; 95\% CI=0.270, 1.126, p=0.002) and TMT-B (β=2.573; 95\% CI=1.200, 3.947, p{\textless}0.001). Changes in WMH volume are associated with declines in information processing speed and executive function in non-demented older adults with memory complaints.

	abstract = {Because they bridge the genetic gap between rodents and humans, non-human primates (NHPs) play a major role in therapy development and evaluation for neurological disorders. However, translational research success from NHPs to patients requires an accurate phenotyping of the models. In patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with automated segmentation methods has offered the unique opportunity to assess in vivo brain morphological changes. Meanwhile, specific challenges caused by brain size and high field contrasts make existing algorithms hard to use routinely in NHPs. To tackle this issue, we propose a complete pipeline, Primatologist, for multi-region segmentation. Tissue segmentation is based on a modular statistical model that includes random field regularization, bias correction and denoising and is optimized by expectation-maximization. To deal with the broad variety of structures with different relaxing times at 7 T, images are segmented into 17 anatomical classes, including subcortical regions. Pre-processing steps insure a good initialization of the parameters and thus the robustness of the pipeline. It is validated on 10 T2-weighted MRIs of healthy macaque brains. Classification scores are compared with those of a non-linear atlas registration, and the impact of each module on classification scores is thoroughly evaluated.},

	doi = {10.1111/bdi.12664},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Brain sulcation is an indirect marker of neurodevelopmental processes. Studies of the cortical sulcation in bipolar disorder have yielded mixed results, probably due to high variability in clinical phenotype. We investigated whole-brain cortical sulcation in a large sample of selected patients with high neurodevelopmental load.
METHODS: A total of 263 patients with bipolar disorder I and 320 controls were included in a multicentric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. All subjects underwent high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI. Images were processed with an automatized pipeline to extract the global sulcal index (g-SI) and the local sulcal indices (l-SIs) from 12 a priori determined brain regions covering the whole brain. We compared l-SI and g-SI between patients with and without early-onset bipolar disorder and between patients with and without a positive history of psychosis, adjusting for age, gender and handedness.
RESULTS: Patients with early-onset bipolar disorder had a higher l-SI in the right prefrontal dorsolateral region. Patients with psychotic bipolar disorder had a decreased l-SI in the left superior parietal cortex. No group differences in g-SI or l-SI were found between healthy subjects and the whole patient cohort. We could replicate the early-onset finding in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that bipolar disorder is not associated with generalized abnormalities of sulcation, but rather with localized changes of cortical folding restricted to patients with a heavy neurodevelopmental loading. These findings support the hypothesis that bipolar disorder is heterogeneous but may be disentangled using MRI, and suggest the need for investigations into neurodevelopmental deviations in the disorder.},

	abstract = {The current theory implying local, short-range overconnectivity in autism spectrum disorder, contrasting with long-range underconnectivity, is based on heterogeneous results, on limited data involving functional connectivity studies, on heterogeneous paediatric populations and non-specific methodologies. In this work, we studied short-distance structural connectivity in a homogeneous population of males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and used a novel methodology specifically suited for assessing U-shaped short-distance tracts, including a recently developed tractography-based atlas of the superficial white matter fibres. We acquired diffusion-weighted MRI for 58 males (27 subjects with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and 31 control subjects) and extracted the mean generalized fractional anisotropy of 63 short-distance tracts. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV), Communication Checklist-Adult, Empathy Quotient, Social Responsiveness Scale and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). In contradiction with the models of short-range over-connectivity in autism spectrum disorder, we found that patients with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly decreased anatomical connectivity in a component comprising 13 short tracts compared to controls. Specific short-tract atypicalities in temporal lobe and insula were significantly associated with clinical manifestations of autism spectrum disorder such as social awareness, language structure, pragmatic skills and empathy, emphasizing their importance in social dysfunction. Short-range decreased anatomical connectivity may thus be an important substrate of social deficits in autism spectrum disorder, in contrast with current models.},

	abstract = {In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS), ictal discharge spread to the frontal and insulo-perisylvian cortex is commonly observed. The implication of white matter pathways in this propagation has not been investigated. We compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements along the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a major tract connecting the frontal and temporal lobes, in patients and controls. Ten right-handed patients referred for intractable TLE due to a right HS were investigated on a 1.5-T MR scanner including a DTI sequence. All patients had interictal fluorodeoxyglucose PET showing an ipsilateral temporal hypometabolism associated with insular and frontal or perisylvian hypometabolism. The controls consisted of ten right-handed healthy subjects. UF fiber tracking was performed, and its fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between patients and controls, separately for the right and left UF. The left-minus-right FA UF asymmetry index was computed to test for intergroup differences. Asymmetries were found in the control group with right-greater-than-left FA. This asymmetrical pattern was lost in the patient group. Right FA values were lower in patients with right HS versus controls. Although preliminary, these findings may be related to the preferential pathway of seizure spread from the mesial temporal lobe to frontal and insulo-perisylvian areas.},

	abstract = {We describe here a classification system based on automatically identified cortical sulci. Multivariate recognition methods are required for the detection of complex brain patterns with a spatial distribution. However, such methods may face the well-known issue of the curse of dimensionality-the risk of overfitting the training dataset in high-dimensional space. We overcame this problem, using a classifier pipeline with one- or two-stage of descriptor selection based on machine-learning methods, followed by a support vector machine classifier or linear discriminant analysis. We compared alternative designs of the pipeline on two different datasets built from the same database corresponding to 151 brains. The first dataset dealt with cortex asymmetry and the second dealt with the effect of the subject's sex. Our system successfully (98\%) distinguished between the left and right hemispheres on the basis of sulcal shape (size, depth, etc.). The sex of the subject could be determined with a success rate of 85\%. These results highlight the attractiveness of multivariate recognition models combined with appropriate descriptor selection. The sulci selected by the pipeline are consistent with previous whole-brain studies on sex effects and hemispheric asymmetries.},

	abstract = {This paper exploits the idea that each individual brain region has a specific connection profile to create parcellations of the cortical mantle using MR diffusion imaging. The parcellation is performed in two steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus recognition system. Then, for each voxel of the cortex, a connection profile is computed using a probabilistic tractography framework. The tractography is performed from q fields using regularized particle trajectories. Fiber ODF are inferred from the q-balls using a sharpening process focusing the weight around the q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly aligned with the diffusion data prevents the particles from crossing the cortical folds. During propagation, the particles father child particles in order to improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each voxel, intersection of the particle trajectories with the gyri lead to a connectivity profile made up of only 36 connection strengths. These profiles are clustered on a gyrus by gyrus basis using a K-means approach including spatial regularization. The reproducibility of the results is studied for three subjects using spatial normalization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunes are a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease. Although still debated, the morphological features of lacunes may offer mechanistic insights. We systematically analyzed the shape of incident lacunes in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a genetically defined small vessel disease.
METHODS: A total of 88 incident lacunes from 57 patients were segmented from 3-dimensional T1 magnetic resonance images and 3 dimensionally reconstructed. Anatomic location, diameter, volume, surface area, and compactness of lacunes were assessed. The shape was analyzed using a size, orientation, and position invariant spectral shape descriptor. We further investigated the relationship with perforating arteries and fiber tracts.
RESULTS: Lacunes were most abundant in the centrum semiovale and the basal ganglia. Diameter, volume, and surface area of lacunes in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were larger than in other brain regions. The spectral shape descriptor revealed a continuum of shapes with no evidence for distinct classes of lacunes. Shapes varied mostly in elongation and planarity. The main axis and plane of lacunes were found to align with the orientation of perforating arteries but not with fiber tracts.
CONCLUSIONS: Elongation and planarity are the primary shape principles of lacunes. Their main axis and plane align with perforating arteries. Our findings add to current concepts on the mechanisms of lacunes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To obtain simple models predicting disease evolution at 3 years for a given patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
METHODS: Based on data obtained in a prospective study of 236 patients, we built and validated models predicting, at the individual level, 3-year changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), Trail Making Test version B (TMTB), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). These models were based on different sets of predictors obtained at baseline, including either clinical data (epidemiologic data and cardiovascular risk factors) or clinical data and quantitative MRI markers (volume of lacunes [LLV], volume of white matter hyperintensities, normalized brain volume [BPF], number of microbleeds). The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were used to determine models with the highest predictive ability and the lowest numbers of predictors.
RESULTS: We obtained validated models with a demonstrated ability to predict, for a given patient, 3-year changes in MMSE, MDRS, TMTB, and mRS (R2 on independent samples: 0.22, 0.12, 0.09, and 0.17, respectively). In all cases, the best models according to R2 and BIC values included only the baseline values of the outcome, of BPF, and of LLV. Inclusion of other potential predictors always led to a loss of generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of 3-year changes in MMSE, MDRS, TMTB, and mRS for a given patient with CADASIL can be obtained using simple models relying only on the initial values of the considered score, BPF, and LLV.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences of cortical morphology between HC, MCI, and AD patients using a new post-processing method based on reconstruction and identification of cortical sulci. Thirty HC, 33 MCI, and 30 AD patients were randomly selected from the ADNI database. For each subject, cortical sulci were reconstructed and automatically identified using Brainvisa software. Depth and fold opening of nine large sulci were compared between HC, MCI, and AD patients. Fold opening of parietaloccipital fissure and intraparietal sulcus on both sides strongly differed between the 3 groups, with gradual increase from HC to MCI of about 1 mm and from MCI to AD of about 2 mm (right intraparietal: p = 0.005; left intraparietal: p = 0.004; right parietaloccipital: p = 0.003; left parietaloccipital: p = 0.0009). Results were left unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, and level of education. These variables were also strongly linked to neuropsychological scores, independent of age, gender, and level of education. In the present study, we found important regional differences of cortical morphology with gradual deterioration from HC to MCI to AD. The most important differences were found in parietaloccipital fissure and intraparietal sulcus. Further studies are needed to understand the involved underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both brain and cognitive reserves modulate the clinical impact of chronic brain diseases. Whether a motor reserve also modulates the relationships between stroke and disability is unknown. We aimed to determine whether the shape of the central sulcus, a marker of the development of underlying motor connections, is independently associated with disability in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Shapes of central sulci were reconstructed from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and ordered without supervision according to a validated algorithm in 166 patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke caused by CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy With Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), a severe monogenic cerebral small vessel disease affecting young patients. Ordinal logistic regression modeling was used to test the relationships between modified Rankin scale, a disability scale strongly weighted toward motor disability, and sulcal shape.
RESULTS: Modified Rankin scale was strongly associated with sulcal shape, independent of age, sex, and level of education (proportional odds ratio =1.19, 95\% confidence interval =1.06-1.35; P=0.002). Results remained significant after further adjustment for brain atrophy, volume of lacunes, and volume of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of disability in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke caused by a severe cerebral small vessel disease is related to the shape of the central sulcus, independently of the main determinants of disability. These results support the concept of a motor reserve that could modulate the clinical severity in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Objective: In CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered to result from hypoperfusion. We hypothesized that in fact the burden of WMH results from the combination of several regional populations of WMH with different mechanisms and clinical consequences. Methods: To identify regional WMH populations, we used a 4-step approach. First, we used an unsupervised principal component algorithm to determine, without a priori knowledge, the main sources of variation of the global spatial pattern of WMH. Thereafter, to determine whether these sources are likely to include relevant information regarding regional populations of WMH, we tested their relationships with: (1) MRI markers of the disease; (2) the clinical severity assessed by the Mattis Dementia Rating scale (MDRS) (cognitive outcome) and the modified Rankin's score (disability outcome). Finally, through careful interpretation of all the results, we tried to identify different regional populations of WMH. Results: The unsupervised principal component algorithm identified 3 main sources of variation of the global spatial pattern of WMH, which showed significant and sometime inverse relationships with MRI markers and clinical scores. The models predicting clinical severity based on these sources outperformed those evaluating WMH by their volume (MDRS, coefficient of determination of 39.0 vs. 35.3\%, p = 0.01; modified Rankin's score, 43.7 vs. 38.1\%, p = 0.001). By carefully interpreting the visual aspect of these sources as well as their relationships with MRI markers and clinical severity, we found strong arguments supporting the existence of different regional populations of WMH. For instance, in multivariate analyses, larger extents of WMH in anterior temporal poles and superior frontal gyri were associated with better outcomes, while larger extents of WMH in pyramidal tracts were associated with worse outcomes, which could not be explained if WMH in these different areas shared the same mechanisms. Conclusion: The results of the present study support the hypothesis that the whole extent of WMH results from a combination of different regional populations of WMH, some of which are associated, for yet undetermined reasons, with milder forms of the disease.},

	abstract = {The extreme variability of the folding pattern of the human cortex makes the recognition of cortical sulci, both automatic and manual, particularly challenging. Reliable identification of the human cortical sulci in its entirety, is extremely difficult and is practiced by only a few experts. Moreover, these sulci correspond to more than a hundred different structures, which makes manual labeling long and fastidious and therefore limits access to large labeled databases to train machine learning. Here, we seek to improve the current model proposed in the Morphologist toolbox, a widely used sulcus recognition toolbox included in the BrainVISA package. Two novel approaches are proposed: patch-based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) techniques and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches. Both are currently applied for anatomical segmentations because they embed much better representations of inter-subject variability than approaches based on a single template atlas. However, these methods typically focus on voxel-wise labeling, disregarding certain geometrical and topological properties of interest for sulcus morphometry. Therefore, we propose to refine these approaches with domain specific bottom-up geometric constraints provided by the Morphologist toolbox. These constraints are utilized to provide a single sulcus label to each topologically elementary fold, the building blocks of the pattern recognition problem. To eliminate the shortcomings associated with the Morphologist’s pre-segmentation into elementary folds, we complement this regularization scheme using a top-down perspective which triggers an additional cleavage of the elementary folds when required. All the newly proposed models outperform the current Morphologist model, the most efficient being a CNN U-Net-based approach which carries out sulcus recognition within a few seconds.},

After a few pioneer studies looking into it in post-mortem foetal specimen, modern approaches based on neuroimaging have allowed the community to investigate the folding process in vivo, its normal progression, its early disturbances, and its relationship to later functional outcomes. In this review article, we aimed to first give an overview of the current hypotheses on the mechanisms governing cortical folding. After describing the methodological difficulties raised by its study in fetuses, neonates and infants with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we reported our current understanding of sulcal pattern emergence in the developing brain. We then highlighted the functional relevance of early sulcal development, through recent insights about hemispheric asymmetries and early factors influencing this dynamic such as prematurity. Finally, we outlined how longitudinal studies have started to relate early folding markers and the child’s sensorimotor and cognitive outcome. Through this review, we hope to raise awareness on the potential of studying early sulcal patterns both from a fundamental and clinical perspective, as a window into early neurodevelopment and plasticity in relation to growth in utero and postnatal environment of the child.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which patients show progressively worsening motor symptoms, often followed by cognitive impairment and dementia. Brain MRI can be used to identify patterns of neurodegeneration that are characteristic of PD, but the spatial pattern of brain abnormalities is still not well understood. “Sulcus-based morphometry” provides measures of the cortical fissures of the brain that reflect degenerative changes in relation to neuropsychiatric disease. Extracting sulci requires good contrast between the gray matter and the CSF, and less well-defined sulci may be difficult to extract reliably. Before embarking on a study of sulcal abnormalities in PD, we set out to determine the reliability of measures from 123 sulci, defined by an existing atlas, using publicly available test-retest data from 8 cohorts. Of the 123 atlas-defined sulci, several major sulci were broken down into smaller regions (e.g., the superior temporal sulcus was divided into the main STS, the anterior terminal ascending branch of STS and the posterior terminal ascending branch of STS); we assessed reliability in each individually, and after merging the portions of the sulci together, in a newly defined, concatenated atlas. For 467 subjects from the PPMI cohort (http://www.ppmiinfo. org ;age range: 61.5 \&plusmn; 10.1 years), we segmented and labeled major sulci and extracted 4 shape descriptors for each: length, depth, surface area, and width. We then aimed to establish the profile of case-control differences for 3 candidate sulci of interest: the central sulcus, superior temporal sulcus and the calcarine fissure. These sulci were among the more robust in terms of reproducibility; we found that the calcarine width was associated with PD, offering new features for genetic and interventional studies of PD.},

	abstract = {It is a fact that the brain cortical folding pattern morphology is specific to each human being. Neuroanatomists think that the folding pattern is strongly related to brain connectivity [1]. As each folding variation implies a specific rearrangement of the different white matter bundles, it also impacts the position of functional regions. This particularity raises an issue for precise brain spatial normalization, as nobody knows how to align brains with different folding patterns. For this reason, in the field of brain segmentation, old fashion approaches relying on a single model, often generated from a single subject or a group’s average, cannot overcome the folding variability. Therefore, modern strategies are often built from a multi-subject atlas, which has proven to be a very efficient solution to overcome this difficulty [2]. In order to design an analogous solution for brain mapping, it was recently proposed to restrict statistical analysis to groups of subjects with compatible folding pattern [3], which has been experimented to deal with the impact of the central sulcus morphology on fMRI-based activation maps [4]. Differences in the cortical folding have been proved to be associated with differences in the localization of functional areas. Therefore, we need to understand better how to relate to each other brains with different folding patterns. In this abstract, we propose a new step in this direction: we performed a first attempt to observe an effect of a simple morphological polymorphism related to central sulcus on the underlying U-fiber organization.},

In parallel to morphological changes in brain size and gyrification, several microstructural changes occur in the cortex, such as the development of dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis and pruning, and fiber myelination. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide indirect markers of these mechanisms through the mapping of quantitative parameters. Here, we used a dedicated methodological framework to perform reliable voxel-wise analyses over the infant cortex. The examination of hemispheric asymmetries in microstructure required careful alignment of morphological asymmetries through registration of native and flipped brains using a 2-step matching strategy of sulci (DISCO approach) and cortical ribbon (DAR℡ approach). We tested the potential of this approach in 1-to-5-month-old infants, with a focus on cortical longitudinal diffusivity from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). This enabled us to unravel different microstructural evolution patterns of specific sensorimotor and language regions in the left and right hemispheres.},

To cope with this issue, this study focused on the evolution of the central sulcus’ variability of 71 preterm infants studied longitudinally with MRI at 30 and 40 weeks (w) postmenstrual age (PMA). Our aim was to investigate the main shape characteristics and whether they are encoded early on or appear closer to term birth. We captured shape dissimilarity between the sulci using a distance matrix after pairwise co-registration using an Iterative Closest Point algorithm. We applied non-linear dimensionality reduction to this matrix using the Isomap algorithm in order to capture the most discriminative shape features among the central sulci. We characterized the three most discriminative features over the group, and found that the sulci evolved consistently from a given feature at 30w PMA to the 40w PMA equivalent feature. We incidentally captured a feature that could coincide with the most discriminative adult feature, both visually and by its asymmetry in left and right sulcal distribution. These results captured the main shape features of the central sulcus in preterm infants and suggest that they are already encoded at 30w PMA.},

Deep learning is used to provide a top-down perspective to a classical bottom-up pattern recognition system. Our original approach is compared with the approach proposed in the BrainVISA package (www.brainvisa.info), the most used sulcus recognition toolbox. As far as we know, this is the first time that CNNs is used for sulcus recognition. We show that our approach outperforms the BrainVISA method.},

	abstract = {Whether phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia are associated with impaired neural sampling of auditory information is still under debate. Previous findings suggested that dyslexic participants showed atypical neural entrainment to slow and/or fast temporal modulations in speech, which might affect prosodic/syllabic and phonemic processing respectively. However, the large methodological variations across these studies do not allow us to draw clear conclusions on the nature of the entrainment deficit in dyslexia. Using magnetoencephalography, we measured neural entrainment to nonspeech and speech in both groups. We first aimed to conceptually replicate previous studies on auditory entrainment in dyslexia, using the same measurement methods as in previous studies, and also using new measurement methods (cross-correlation analyses) to better characterize the synchronization between stimulus and brain response. We failed to observe any of the significant group differences that had previously been reported in delta, theta and gamma frequency bands, whether using speech or nonspeech stimuli. However, when analyzing amplitude cross-correlations between noise stimuli and brain responses, we found that control participants showed larger responses than dyslexic participants in the delta range in the right hemisphere and in the gamma range in the left hemisphere. Overall, our results are weakly consistent with the hypothesis that dyslexic individuals show an atypical entrainment to temporal modulations. Our attempt at replicating previously published results highlights the multiple weaknesses of this research area, particularly low statistical power due to small sample size, and the lack of methodological standards inducing considerable heterogeneity of measurement and analysis methods across studies.},

Because of this large normal variability, the identification of abnormal patterns associated to developmental disorders is a complex open challenge. In this paper, we tackle this problem as an anomaly detection task and explore the potential of deep generative models using benchmarks made up of synthetic anomalies. To focus learning on the folding geometry, brain MRI are preprocessed first to deal only with a skeleton-based negative cast of the cortex. A variational auto-encoder is trained to get a representation of the regional variability of the folding pattern of the general population. Then several synthetic benchmark datasets of abnormalities are designed. The latent space expressivity is assessed through classification experiments between control’s and abnormal’s latent codes. Finally, the properties encoded in the latent space are analyzed through perturbation of specific latent dimensions and observation of the resulting modification of the reconstructed images. The results have shown that the latent representation is rich enough to distinguish subtle differences like asymmetries between the right and left hemispheres.},

	abstract = {Palaeoneurology is a complex field as the object of study, the brain, does not fossilize. Studies rely therefore on the (brain) endocranial cast (often named endocast), the only available and reliable proxy for brain shape, size and details of surface. However, researchers debate whether or not specific marks found on endocasts correspond reliably to particular sulci and/or gyri of the brain that were imprinted in the braincase. The aim of this study is to measure the accuracy of sulcal identification through an experiment that reproduces the conditions that palaeoneurologists face when working with hominin endocasts. We asked 14 experts to manually identify well-known foldings in a proxy endocast that was obtained from an MRI of an actual in vivo Homo sapiens head. We observe clear differences in the results when comparing the non-corrected labels (the original labels proposed by each expert) with the corrected labels. This result illustrates that trying to reconstruct a sulcus following the very general known shape/position in the literature or from a mean specimen may induce a bias when looking at an endocast and trying to follow the marks observed there. We also observe that the identification of sulci appears to be better in the lower part of the endocast compared to the upper part. The results concerning specific anatomical traits have implications for highly debated topics in palaeoanthropology. Endocranial description of fossil specimens should in the future consider the variation in position and shape of sulci in addition to using models of mean brain shape. Moreover, it is clear from this study that researchers can perceive sulcal imprints with reasonably high accuracy, but their correct identification and labelling remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with extinct species for which we lack direct knowledge of the brain.},

In this context, understanding physiological aging and its turning point into neurodegeneration is essential for the development of possible biomarkers and future therapeutics of brain disease.
            
            
              Methods
              The SENIOR study represents a longitudinal, observational study including cognitively healthy elderlies aged between 50 and 70 years old at the time of inclusion, being followed annually over 10 years. Our multimodal protocol includes structural, diffusion, functional, and sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T and 7 T, positron emission tomography (PET), blood samples, genetics, audiometry, and neuropsychological and neurological examinations as well as assessment of neuronal risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              One hundred forty-two participants (50\% females) were enrolled in the SENIOR cohort with a mean age of 60 (SD 6.3) years at baseline. Baseline results with multiple regression analyses reveal that cerebral white matter lesions can be predicted by cardiovascular and cognitive risk factors and age. Cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with juxtacortical and periventricular lesions. Intra-subject across-test variability as a measure of neuropsychological test performance and possible cognitive marker predicts white matter volume and is significantly associated with risk profile. Division of the cohort into subjects with a higher and lower risk profile shows significant differences in intra-subject across-test variability and volumes as well as cortical thickness of brain regions of the temporal lobe. There is no difference between the lower- and higher-risk groups in amyloid load using PET data from a subset of 81 subjects.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated, multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We show that intra-subject across-test variability as a marker of neuropsychological test performance as well as age, gender, and combined risk factors influence neuronal decline as represented by decrease in brain volume, cortical thickness, and increase in white matter lesions. Baseline findings will be used as underlying basis for the further implications of aging and neuronal degeneration as well as examination of brain aging under different aspects of brain pathology versus physiological aging.},

              Background
              Diffusion MRI is the preferred non-invasive in vivo modality for the study of brain white matter connections. Tractography datasets contain 3D streamlines that can be analyzed to study the main brain white matter tracts. Fiber clustering methods have been used to automatically group similar fibers into clusters. However, due to inter-subject variability and artifacts, the resulting clusters are difficult to process for finding common connections across subjects, specially for superficial white matter.
            
            
              Methods
              We present an automatic method for labeling of short association bundles on a group of subjects. The method is based on an intra-subject fiber clustering that generates compact fiber clusters. Posteriorly, the clusters are labeled based on the cortical connectivity of the fibers, taking as reference the Desikan–Killiany atlas, and named according to their relative position along one axis. Finally, two different strategies were applied and compared for the labeling of inter-subject bundles: a matching with the Hungarian algorithm, and a well-known fiber clustering algorithm, called QuickBundles.
            
            
              Results
              Individual labeling was executed over four subjects, with an execution time of 3.6 min. An inspection of individual labeling based on a distance measure showed good correspondence among the four tested subjects. Two inter-subject labeling were successfully implemented and applied to 20 subjects and compared using a set of distance thresholds, ranging from a conservative value of 10 mm to a moderate value of 21 mm. Hungarian algorithm led to a high correspondence, but low reproducibility for all the thresholds, with 96 s of execution time. QuickBundles led to better correspondence, reproducibility and short execution time of 9 s. Hence, the whole processing for the inter-subject labeling over 20 subjects takes 1.17 h.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We implemented a method for the automatic labeling of short bundles in individuals, based on an intra-subject clustering and the connectivity of the clusters with the cortex. The labels provide useful information for the visualization and analysis of individual connections, which is very difficult without any additional information. Furthermore, we provide two fast inter-subject bundle labeling methods. The obtained clusters could be used for performing manual or automatic connectivity analysis in individuals or across subjects.},

	abstract = {In some cases of pharmaco-resistant and focal epilepsies, intracranial recordings performed epidurally (electrocorticography, ECoG) and/or in depth (stereoelectroencephalography, SEEG) can be required to locate the seizure onset zone and the eloquent cortex before surgical resection. In SEEG, each electrode contact records brain’s electrical activity in a spherical volume of 3 mm diameter approximately. The spatial coverage is around 1\% of the brain and differs between patients because the implantation of electrodes is tailored for each case. Group studies thus need a large number of patients to reach a large spatial sampling, which can be achieved more easily using a multicentric approach such as implemented in our F-TRACT project (f-tract.eu). To facilitate group studies, we developed a software—IntrAnat Electrodes—that allows to perform virtual electrode implantation in patients’ neuroanatomy and to overlay results of epileptic and functional mapping, as well as resection masks from the surgery. IntrAnat Electrodes is based on a patient database providing multiple search criteria to highlight various group features. For each patient, the anatomical processing is based on a series of software publicly available. Imaging modalities (Positron Emission Tomography (PET), anatomical MRI pre-implantation, post-implantation and post-resection, functional MRI, diffusion MRI, Computed Tomography (CT) with electrodes) are coregistered. The 3D T1 pre-implantation MRI gray/white matter is segmented and spatially normalized to obtain a series of cortical parcels using different neuroanatomical atlases. On post-implantation images, the user can position 3D models of electrodes defined by their geometry. Each electrode contact is then labeled according to its position in the anatomical atlases, to the class of tissue (gray or white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid) and to its presence inside or outside the resection mask. Users can add more functionally informed labels on contact, such as clinical responses after electrical stimulation, cortico-cortical evoked potentials, gamma band activity during cognitive tasks or epileptogenicity. IntrAnat Electrodes software thus provides a means to visualize multimodal data. The contact labels allow to search for patients in the database according to multiple criteria representing almost all available data, which is to our knowledge unique in current SEEG software. IntrAnat Electrodes will be available in the forthcoming release of BrainVisa software and tutorials can be found on the F-TRACT webpage.},

Such abnormalities might denote abnormal cortical folding development, which can now be investigated using gyrification measures. Anatomic magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were obtained from 30 schizophrenia patients screened for resistant auditory hallucinations and 28 control subjects. We searched for overall gyrification abnormalities in the whole cortex as well as localized abnormalities in language-related cortex, assuming that gyrification is associated with brain sulcation. A fully automated method was applied to MRIs to extract, label and measure the sulcus area in the whole cortex. Gyrification was assessed using both global and local sulcal indices, respectively the ratio between total sulcal area, or area of each labeled sulcus, and outer cortex area. For both hemispheres, the patients had a lower global sulcal index. The local sulcal index decrease was not homogeneous across the whole cortex. It was more significant in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally, in the left middle frontal sulcus and in the diagonal branch of left sylvian fissure (Broca's area). Findings suggest abnormalities in cortical gyrification in these patients. Sulcal abnormalities in language-related cortex might underlie these patients' particular vulnerability to hallucinations.},

	abstract = {Learning with discriminative methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension. In such situations, dimension reduction becomes a crucial issue. We propose a feature selection/classification algorithm based on generative methods in order to predict the clinical status of a highly imbalanced dataset made of PET scans of forty-five low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and thirteen non-ASD low functioning children. ASDs are typically characterized by impaired social interaction, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors, with a high variability in expression and severity. The numerous findings revealed by brain imaging studies suggest that ASD is associated with a complex and distributed pattern of abnormalities that makes the identification of a shared and common neuroimaging profile a difficult task. In this context, our goal is to identify the rest functional brain imaging abnormalities pattern associated with ASD and to validate its efficiency in individual classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm detected a characteristic pattern in the ASD group that included a hypoperfusion in the right Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and a hyperperfusion in the contralateral postcentral area. Our algorithm allowed for a significantly accurate (88\%), sensitive (91\%) and specific (77\%) prediction of clinical category. For this imbalanced dataset, with only 13 control scans, the proposed generative algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art discriminant methods. The high predictive power of the characteristic pattern, which has been automatically identified on whole brains without any priors, confirms previous findings concerning the role of STS in ASD. This work offers exciting possibilities for early autism detection and/or the evaluation of treatment response in individual patients.},

This study aimed to identify WM abnormalities that differentiate patients with BD from healthy controls (HC) in the largest DTI dataset of patients with BD to date, collected via the ENIGMA network. We gathered individual tensor-derived regional metrics from 26 cohorts leading to a sample size of N = 3033 (1482 BD and 1551 HC). Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from 43 regions of interest (ROI) and average whole-brain FA were entered into univariate mega- and meta-analyses to differentiate patients with BD from HC. Mega-analysis revealed significantly lower FA in patients with BD compared with HC in 29 regions, with the highest effect sizes observed within the corpus callosum (R2 = 0.041, Pcorr {\textless} 0.001) and cingulum (right: R2 = 0.041, left: R2 = 0.040, Pcorr {\textless} 0.001). Lithium medication, later onset and short disease duration were related to higher FA along multiple ROIs. Results of the meta-analysis showed similar effects. We demonstrated widespread WM abnormalities in BD and highlighted that altered WM connectivity within the corpus callosum and the cingulum are strongly associated with BD. These brain abnormalities could represent a biomarker for use in the diagnosis of BD. Interactive three-dimensional visualization of the results is available at www.enigma-viewer.org.},

	abstract = {In CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leucoencephalopathy), a genetic model of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), clinical status was previously found related to cortex morphology. In the present report, alterations of cortex morphology and their links to clinical worsening were investigated in 190 CADASIL patients followed during 24.4 months. Linear models were used to test relationships between: (1) clinical worsening and changes of depth of cortical sulci and of cortical thickness; (2) alterations of cortical morphology and changes of volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH(v)) and of lacunar lesions (LL(v)). Reduction of sulcal depth was independently associated with increased time to complete trail making test A and B (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.004) and that of cortical thickness to increased disability (modified Rankin's scale, p = 0.008), while brain atrophy was only related to global cognitive worsening (Mattis dementia rating scale, p = 0.002). The impact of volume of lacunar lesions on cortical alterations was larger than that of volume of white matter hyperintensities. Cortical alterations, mainly related to lacunar lesions, evolve parallel to clinical worsening. These results further support the eventual role of cortical alterations in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.},

These descriptors, which have been introduced more than a decade ago, are invariant relatively to rotations, translations and scale and can be computed for any topology. A rapid insight into the derivation of these invariants is proposed first. Then, their potential to characterize shapes is shown from a principal component analysis of the 12 first invariants computed for 12 different deep brain structures manually drawn for 7 different brains. Finally, these invariants are used to find some correlates of handedness and sex among the shapes of 116 different cortical sulci automatically identified in each of 142 brains of the ICBM database.},

The program has developed a framework of using artificial neuroanatomists that are trained to identify sulci from a database. The framework relies on a renormalization of the brain warping problem, which consists in matching the cortices at the scale of the folds. Another component of the program is the search for the alphabet of the folding patterns, namely, a list of indivisible elementary sulci. The search relies on the study of the cortical folding process using antenatal imaging and on backward simulations of morphogenesis aimed at revealing traces of the embryologic dimples in the mature cortical surface. The importance of sulcal-based morphometry is illustrated by a simple study of the correlates of handedness on asymmetry indices. The study shows for instance that the central sulcus is larger in the dominant hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Background - Whether multiple nutritional deficiencies have a synergic effect on mobility loss remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate associations between multi-nutritional deficits and physical performance evolution among community-dwelling older adults. Methods - We included 386 participants from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) (75.6 ± 4.5 years) not receiving omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation and who had available data on nutritional deficits. Baseline nutritional deficits were defined as: plasma 25 hydroxyvitamin D 14 μmol/L, or erythrocyte omega-3 PUFA index ≤4.87\% (lower quartile). The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), gait speed and chair rise time were used to assess physical performance at baseline and after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. We explored if the nutrition-physical performance associations varied according to the presence of low-grade inflammation (LGI) and brain imaging indicators. Results - Within-group comparisons showed physical function (decreased SPPB and gait speed; increased chair rise time) worsened over time, particularly in participants with ≥2 nutritional deficits; however, no between-group differences were observed when comparing individuals without deficit and those with either one or ≥2 deficits. Our exploratory analysis on nutritional deficits-LGI interactions showed that, among people ≥2 deficits, chair rise time was increased over time in participants with LGI (adjusted mean difference: 3.47; 95\% CI: 1.03, 5.91; p=0.017), compared to non-LGI individuals. Conclusions - Accumulated deficits on vitamin D, homocysteine and omega-3 PUFA was not associated with physical performance evolution in older adults, but they determined declined chair rise performance in subjects with low-grade inflammation.},

	abstract = {Brain mapping studies often need to identify brain structures or functional circuits into a set of individual brain. To this end, multiple atlases have been published to represent such structures, based on different modalities, subject sets, and techniques. The mainstream approach to exploit these atlases consists in spatially deforming each individual data onto a given atlas using dense deformation fields, which supposes the existence of a continuous mapping between atlases and individuals. However this continuity is not always verified, and this “iconic” approach has limits. We present in this paper an alternative, complementary, “structural” approach, which consists in extracting structures from the individual data, and comparing them without deformation. A “structural atlas” is thus a collection of annotated individual data with a common structure nomenclature. It may be used to characterize structure shape variability across individuals or species, or to train machine learning systems. This paper exhibits Anatomist, a powerful structural 3D visualization software dedicated to building, exploring, and editing structural atlases involving a large number of subjects. It has been developed primarily to decipher the cortical folding variability: cortical sulci vary enormously in both size and shape, some may be missing, or have various topologies, which makes iconic approaches inefficient to study them. We therefore had to build structural atlases for cortical sulci, and use them to train sulci identification algorithms. Anatomist can display multiple subjects data in multiple views, supports all kinds of neuroimaging data including compound structural object graphs, handles arbitrary coordinate transformation chains between data, and has multiple display features. It is designed as a programming library in both C++ and Python languages, and may be extended or used to build dedicated custom applications. Its generic design makes all the display and structural aspects used to explore the variability of the cortical folding pattern work in other applications, for instance to browse axonal fiber bundles, deep nuclei, functional activations, or other kinds of cortical parcellations. Multimodal, multi-individual, or inter-species display is supported, and adaptations to large scale screen walls have been developed. These very original features makes it a unique viewer for structural atlas browsing.},

Overall, in analyses adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume, the presence of APOE4 was associated with lower total gray matter volume at baseline and with a higher atrophy rate over the follow-up. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were the two gray matter regions most associated with APOE4. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors had little impact on these associations. There was an interaction between age, APOE4 status and total brain volume atrophy rate, with evidence of an earlier age at onset of atrophy in hippocampal volume in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Those results are in accordance with the role of medial temporal structures in the greater risk of dementia observed in people carrying the APOE4 allele.},

	abstract = {Despite growing evidence of links between sulcation and function in the adult brain, the folding dynamics, occurring mostly before normal-term-birth, is vastly unknown. Looking into the development of cortical sulci in infants can give us keys to address fundamental questions: what is the sulcal shape variability in the developing brain? When are the shape features encoded? How are these morphological parameters related to further functional development? In this study, we aimed to investigate the shape variability of the developing central sulcus, which is the frontier between the primary somatosensory and motor cortices. We studied a cohort of 71 extremely preterm infants scanned twice using MRI – once around 30 weeks post-menstrual age (w PMA) and once at term-equivalent age, around 40w PMA –, in order to quantify the sulcus's shape variability using manifold learning, regardless of age-group or hemisphere. We then used these shape descriptors to evaluate the sulcus's variability at both ages and to assess hemispheric and age-group specificities. This led us to propose a description of ten shape features capturing the variability in the central sulcus of preterm infants. Our results suggested that most of these features (8/10) are encoded as early as 30w PMA. We unprecedentedly observed hemispheric asymmetries at both ages, and the one captured at term-equivalent age seems to correspond with the asymmetry pattern previously reported in adults. We further trained classifiers in order to explore the predictive value of these shape features on manual performance at 5 years of age (handedness and fine motor outcome). The central sulcus's shape alone showed a limited but relevant predictive capacity in both cases. The study of sulcal shape features during early neurodevelopment may participate to a better comprehension of the complex links between morphological and functional organization of the developing brain.},

	abstract = {Background
Frailty may in most cases result from two main causes: the aging process (age-related frailty) and diseases (evolving chronic conditions or acute medical illnesses — disease-related frailty). The biological determinants characterizing these two main causes of frailty may be different.
Objectives
The aim of this study is to compare the biological and neuroimaging profile of people without frailty, those with age-related frailty, and subjects with disease-related frailty in community-dwelling older adults.
Material and Methods
We performed a secondary, cross-sectional analysis from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). We included 1199 subjects without frailty throughout the 5-year follow-up, 82 subjects with incident age-related frailty, and 53 with incident disease-related frailty. Available blood biomarkers involved nutritional (eg, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids), inflammatory-related (IL-6, TNFR1, GDF15), neurodegenerative (eg, beta-amyloid, neurofilament light chain) and neuroimaging markers (MRI, Amyloid-PET).
Results
Although not statistically significant, the results of the unadjusted model showed increasing gradients for inflammatory markers (GDF15, TNFR1) and decreasing gradients for nutritional and neuroimaging markers (omega 3 index, hippocampal volume) from age-related frailty participants to individuals with disease-related frailty. Considering the linear models we observed higher GDF15 values in disease-related frailty group compared to age-related frailty individuals [β = 242.8 (49.5, 436.2)]. We did not find any significant difference between subjects without frailty and those with age-related frailty. Subjects with disease-related frailty compared to subjects without frailty had lower values of DHA [β = −2.42 (−4.76, −0.08)], Omega 3 Index [β = −0.50 (−0.95, −0.06)] and hippocampal volume [β = −0.22 (−0.42,−0.02)]. They also had higher values of GDF15 [β = 246.1 (88.9, 403.4)] and TNFR1 [β = 157.5 (7.8, 307.2)].
Conclusion
Age-related frailty and disease-related frailty may represent different degrees of frailty severity on a biological level. Further research is needed to identify biomarkers potentially able to distinguish these classifications of frailty.},

	abstract = {Fatigue has been suggested as a marker of biological aging. It seems plausible that this symptom might be associated with changes in brain health. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between persistent fatigue and neuroimaging correlates in a non-disease-specific population of community-dwelling older adults. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). We included 458 subjects. Persistent fatigue was defined as meeting exhaustion criterion of Fried frailty phenotype in two consecutive clinical visits six months apart between study baseline and one year. Brain imaging correlates, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were the outcomes. The associations between persistent fatigue and brain correlates were explored using mixed model linear regressions with random effect at the center level. The mean age of the participants was 74.8 ± 4 years old, and 63\% of the subjects were women. Forty-seven participants (10\%) exhibited a persistent fatigue profile. People with persistent fatigue were older compared to subjects without persistent fatigue (76.2 years ± 4.3 vs.74.7 ± 3.9 p = 0.009). Persistent fatigue was associated with higher white matter hyperintensity volume in the fully adjusted analysis. We did not find any cross-sectional association between persistent fatigue and sub-cortical volumes and global and regional cortical thickness. Persistent fatigue was cross-sectionnally associated with higher white matter hyperintensity volume in older adults. Further longitudinal studies, using an assessment tool specifically designed and validated for measuring fatigue, are needed to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {Each variation of the cortical folding pattern implies a particular rearrangement of the geometry of the fibers of the underlying white matter. While this rearrangement only impacts the ends of the long pathways, it may affect most of the trajectory of the short bundles. Therefore, mapping the short fibers of the human brain using diffusion-based tractography requires a dedicated strategy to overcome the variability of the folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a fiber-based stratification strategy splitting the population into homogeneous groups for disentangling the superficial white matter bundle organization. This strategy introduces a new refined fiber distance which includes angular considerations for inferring fine-grained atlases of the short bundles surrounding a specific sulcus and a subtractogram distance that quantifies the similitude between fiber sets of two different subjects. The stratification splits the population into groups with similar regional fiber organization using manifold learning. We first successfully test the hypothesis that the main source of variability of the regional fiber organization is the variability of the regional folding pattern. Then, in each group, we proceed with the automatic identification of the most stable bundles, at a higher granularity level than what can be achieved with the non-stratified whole population, enabling the disentanglement of the very variable configuration of the short fibers. Finally, the method searches for bundle correspondence across groups to build a population level atlas. As a proof of concept, the atlas refinement achieved by this strategy is illustrated for the fibers that surround the central sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus using the HCP dataset.},

	abstract = {Brain folding patterns vary within the human species, but some folding properties are common across individuals, including the Sylvian fissure’s inter-hemispheric asymmetry. Contrarily to the other brain folds (sulci), the Sylvian fissure develops through the process of opercularization, with the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes growing over the insular lobe. Its asymmetry may be related to the leftward functional lateralization for language processing, but the time course of these asymmetries’ development is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated refined shape features of the Sylvian fissure and their longitudinal development in 71 infants born extremely preterm (mean gestational age at birth: 26.5 weeks) and imaged once before and once at term-equivalent age (TEA). We additionally assessed asymmetrical sulcal patterns at TEA in the perisylvian and inferior frontal regions, neighbor to the Sylvian fissure. While reproducing renowned strong asymmetries in the Sylvian fissure, we captured an early encoding of its main asymmetrical shape features, and we observed global asymmetrical shape features representative of a more pronounced opercularization in the left hemisphere, contrasting with the previously reported right hemisphere advance in sulcation around birth. This added novel insights about the processes governing early-life brain folding mechanisms, potentially linked to the development of language-related capacities.},

	abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is folded, making sulci and gyri over the whole cortical surface. Folding presents a very high inter-subject variability, and some neurodevelopmental disorders are correlated to local folding structures, named folding patterns. However, it is tough to characterize these patterns manually or semi-automatically using geometric distances. Here, we propose a new methodology to identify typical folding patterns. We focus on the cingulate region, known to have a clinical interest, using so-called skeletons (3D representation of folding patterns). We compare two models, \$\${\textbackslash}beta -VAE\$\$β-VAEand SimCLR, in an unsupervised setting to learn a relevant representation of these patterns. We add a decoder to SimCLR to be able to analyse latent space. Specifically, we leverage the data augmentations used in SimCLR to propose a novel kind of augmentations based on folding topology. We then apply a clustering on the latent space. Cluster folding averages, interpolation in the latent space and reconstructions reveal new pattern structures. This structured representation shows that unsupervised learning can help in the discovery of still unknown patterns. We will gain further insights into folding patterns by using new priors in the unsupervised algorithms and integrating other brain data modalities.

	abstract = {The study of short association fibers is still an incomplete task due to their higher inter-subject variability and the smaller size of this kind of fibers in comparison to known long association bundles. However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases. Results for deterministic and probabilistic tractography data show high reproducibility, especially for probabilistic tractography in HCP data. In comparison to previous work, our atlas features a higher number of bundles and greater cortical surface coverage.},

However, the effect of interventions on surrogate markers, in particular imaging biomarkers, remains poorly understood. We conducted a review of the literature and analyzed forty-three interventional studies that included physical exercise, nutrition, cognitive training or multidomain interventions, and assessed various brain imaging biomarkers, to determine the effects of preventive interventions on imaging biomarkers for subjects at-risk to develop AD. Deciphering the global and regional brain effect of each and combined interventions will help to better understand the interplay relationship between multimodal interventions, cognition, surrogate brain markers and to better design primary and secondary outcomes for future preventive clinical trials. Those studies were pondered using generally-admitted quality criteria to reveal that interventions may affect the brain of patients with cognitive impairment rather than those without cognitive impairment thus indicating that particular care should be taken when selecting individuals for interventions. Additionally, a majority of the studies concurred on the effect of the interventions and particularly onto the frontal brain areas.},

The merged sample of SAGE Mexico and TSHA was n = 1 595; sample sizes for external validation were: MAPT n = 1 573 and Frailty day-hospital n = 2 434. The Cox models for incident disability in MAPT had a mean follow-up of 58.6 months.Cutoffs obtained were 14 second (ages 70–79) and 16 second (ages 80+). Those cutoffs identified older adults at higher odds of incident ADL disability odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.06; 2.78) for ages 70–79 and odds ratio (OR) = 2.27 (95\% CI 1.07; 4.80) in those aged 80+. Being a slow chair stander according to the cut points was associated with ADL disability in cross-sectional and longitudinal measures.Fourteen- and 16-second cut points for the CST are suitable to identify people at higher risk of functional decline among older adults in Mexico and Toledo, Spain. Adjusting the cut point from 14 to 16 second generally improved the psychometric properties of the test. The validation of these cutoffs can facilitate the screening for limited mobility and the implementation of the Integrated Care for Older People program.},

To determine the effect of multidomain interventions (involving physical activity, cognitive training, nutritional counseling alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and versus a placebo) on the brain, longitudinal FC changes were assessed after 36 months of intervention in on 100 older adults {\textgreater}(above 70 years’ year-old) and with subjective cognitive complaints. No global change in FC was detected after uni or multidomain preventive interventions. However, an effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation dependent on cognitive decline status was underlined for frontoparietal, salience, visual and sensorimotor networks FC. These findings were independent of the cortical thickness and vascular burden. These results emphasize the importance of patient stratification, based on risk factors, preventive interventions.},

In humans, there is considerable variation in the shape, folding pattern, lateralization, and depth of the STS that have been reported to be associated with social cognition and linguistic functions. We examined the role that genetic factors play on individual variation in STS morphology in chimpanzees. The surface area and depth of the STS were quantified in sample of 292 captive chimpanzees comprised of two genetically isolated population of individuals. The chimpanzees had been previously genotyped for AVPR1A and KIAA0319, two genes that play a role in social cognition and communication in humans. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the KIAA0319 and AVPR1A genes were associated with average depth as well as asymmetries in the STS. By contrast, we found no significant effects of these KIA0319 and AVPR1A polymorphism on surface area and depth measures for the central sulcus. The overall findings indicate that genetic factors account for a small to moderate amount of variation in STS morphology in chimpanzees. These findings are discussed in the context of the role of the STS in social cognition and language in humans and their potential evolutionary origins.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new cortical parcellation method based on group-wise connectivity and hierarchical clustering. A preliminary sub-parcellation is performed using intra-subject and inter-subject fiber clustering to obtain representative bundles among subjects with similar shapes and trajectories. The sub-parcellation is obtained by intersecting fiber clusters with cortical meshes. Next, mean connectivity and mean overlap matrices are computed over the sub-parcels to obtain spatial and connectivity information. To hierarchize the information, we propose to weight both matrices, to obtain an affinity graph, and then a dendrogram to merge or divide parcels by their hierarchy. Finally, to obtain homogeneous parcels, the method computes morphological operations. By selecting a different number of clusters over the dendrogram, the method obtains a different number of parcels and a variation in the resulting parcel sizes, depending on the parameters used. We computed the coefficient of variation (CV ) of the parcel size to evaluate the homogeneity of the parcels. Preliminary results suggest that the use of representative clusters and the integration of sub-parcel overlap and connectivity strength provide useful information to generate cortical parcellations at different levels of granularity. Even results are preliminary, this novel method allows researchers to add group-wise connectivity strength and spatial information for the construction of diffusion-based parcellations. Future work will include a detailed analysis of parameters, such as the matrix weights and the number of sub-parcel clusters, and the generation of hierarchical parcellations to improve the insight into the cortex subdivision and hierarchy among parcels.},

	abstract = {Currently, there are many methods for processing diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography data, with the aim to identify the main white matter connections. However, methods like fiber clustering lack ground truth, making the evaluation of the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms problematic. An alternative to evaluate the performance and test the efficacy of these algorithms is to use simulated fiber datasets. Nevertheless, the simulation of this data is not trivial due to brain fibers’ irregular and complex shape. Although many fiber bundle simulators exist, they have been developed for other purposes, such as validating tractography algorithms or local diffusion models. In addition, these simulators usually use simple fiber bundle configurations without considering complex bundle shapes. With this in mind, the main goal of this work is to implement a simulator of brain fiber bundles based on exponential curves for validating fiber clustering methods. This representation uses bundle centroids and shape parameters to obtain a more realistic appearance of the fascicles. The simulator was validated using a deep white matter fiber bundle atlas, obtaining a good percentage of intersection between the original and simulated bundles, of up to 82\%. Furthermore, we used groups of simulated bundles for the whole brain to evaluate the performance of a fiber clustering algorithm (QuickBundles) when using different distance thresholds, showing the utility of the proposed simulator.},

This method has been designed for the SWM atlas of EBRAINS European infrastructure, which is composed of 657 bundles. The atlas projection relies on the precomputed statistics of six bundle-specific geometrical properties of atlas streamlines. In the spirit of RecoBundles, a global and local streamline-based registration (SBR) is used to align the subject to the atlas space. Then, the streamlines are labeled taking into account the six geometrical parameters describing the similarity to the streamlines in the model bundle. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, GeoLab allows the extraction of more bundles with a higher number of streamlines.},

	abstract = {Background
Age-related changes in brain structure may constitute the starting point for cerebral function alteration. Physical activity (PA) demonstrated favorable associations with total brain volume, but its relationship with cortical thickness (CT) remains unclear. We investigated the cross-sectional associations between PA level and CT in community-dwelling people aged 70 years and older.
Methods
A total of 403 older adults aged 74.8 ± 4.0 years (mean ± SD) who underwent a baseline magnetic resonance imaging examination and who had data on PA and confounders were included. PA was assessed with a questionnaire. Participants were categorized according to PA levels. Multiple linear regressions were used to compare the brain CT (mm) of the inactive group (no PA at all) with 6 active groups (growing PA levels) in 34 regions of interest.
Results
Compared with inactive persons, people who achieved PA at a level of 1500−1999 metabolic equivalent task-min/week (i.e., about 6−7 h of brisk walking for exercise and those who achieved it at 2000−2999 metabolic equivalent task-min/week (i.e., 8−11 h of brisk walking for exercise) had higher CT in the fusiform gyrus and the temporal pole. Additionally, dose−response associations between PA and CT were found in the fusiform gyrus (B = 0.011, SE = 0.004, adj. p = 0.035), the temporal pole (B = 0.026, SE = 0.009, adj. p = 0.048), and the caudal middle frontal gyrus, the entorhinal, medial orbitofrontal, lateral occipital, and insular cortices.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a positive association between PA level and CT in temporal areas such as the fusiform gyrus, a brain region often associated to Alzheimer's disease in people aged 70 years and older. Future investigations focusing on PA type may help to fulfil remaining knowledge gaps in this field.},

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in 2048 patients from the MEMENTO cohort, a French multicenter clinic-based study of outpatients with either isolated cognitive complaints or mild cognitive impairment. Exposure to hypertension was defined as a combination of high blood pressure (BP) status and antihypertensive treatment intake. Pathway associations were examined through structural equation modeling integrating extensive collection of neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical data.

Highlights Paths of hypertension–cognition association were assessed by structural equation models. The hypertension–cognition association is not mediated by Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. The hypertension–cognition association is mediated by neurodegeneration and leukoaraiosis. Lower cognition was limited to participants treated with uncontrolled blood pressure.

	abstract = {Machine learning combined with large-scale neuroimaging databases has been proposed as a promising tool for improving our understanding of the behavioural emergence and early prediction of the neurodevelopmental outcome. A recent example of this strategy is a study by Ouyang et al. (2020) which suggested that cortical microstructure quantified by diffusion MRI through fractional anisotropy (FA) metric in preterm and full-term neonates can lead to effective prediction of language and cognitive outcomes at 2 years of corrected age as assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) composite scores. Given the important need for robust and generalisable tools which can reliably predict the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants, we aimed to replicate the conclusions of this work using a larger independent dataset from the developing Human Connectome Project dataset (dHCP, third release) with early MRI and BSID-III evaluation at 18 months of corrected age. We then aimed to extend the validation of the proposed predictive pipeline through the study of different cohorts (the largest one included 295 neonates, with gestational age between 29 and 42 week and post-menstrual age at MRI between 31 and 45 weeks). This allowed us to evaluate whether some limitations of the original study (mainly small sample size and limited variability in the input and output features used in the predictive models) would influence the prediction results. In contrast to the original study that inspired the current work, our prediction results did not outcompete the random levels. Furthermore, these negative results persisted even when the study settings were expanded. Our findings suggest that the cortical microstructure close to birth described by DTI-FA measures might not be sufficient for a reliable prediction of BSID-III scores during toddlerhood, at least in the current setting, i.e. generally older cohorts and a different processing pipeline. Our inability to conceptually replicate the results of the original study is in line with the previously reported replicability issues within the machine learning field and demonstrates the challenges in defining the good set of practices for the implementation and validation of reliable predictive tools in the neurodevelopmental (and other) fields.},

	title = {On the {Shapes} of the {Precentral} {Gyrus} of {Humans} and {Chimpanzees}},
	url = {https://hal.science/hal-04477128},
	abstract = {The cerebral neocortex, unique to mammals, has the particularity of being folded in many species. This folding is not random but related to the internal structural and functional organization[1,2]. Some patterns can be shared between species, such as the central (CS) and precentral (preCS) sulci in great apes that constitute the boundaries of the precentral gyrus, place of motor cortex (BA 4, and a part of BA6)[3].
We have developed a method to capture the shape variability of cortical sulci within and between species. Here we examine the interindividual variability of the precentral gyrus (preCG) in humans and chimpanzees.
77 chimps (Pan troglodytes) were scanned in vivo at 3T according to US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. Using the "Morphologist 2012" pipeline [4], CSs and preCSs were extracted from T2-weighted images, as well as T1-weighted images of sixty human HCP subjects. All sulci were affinely normalized in Talairach space and then with a species-specific homothetic transformation. Right sulci were flipped to allow comparison with left ones. A pairwise shape similarity matrix was computed after rigid alignment [5]. Isomap-based manifold learning was used to capture two axes describing the greatest parts of variance in the space spanned by the sulci. For better visualization, the sulci were rigidly aligned to the sulcus with the minimum distance to the set and local shape averages were performed at regular intervals along the isomap axes. We performed three experiments for intra- and inter-species comparisons.
Our moving averages capture preCG well in both species. The CS highlights the motor knob of the hand, which is larger, deeper, and more ventral in chimps than in humans. The preCS is mainly composed of two parts, far apart in chimps, corresponding to the inferior preCS (IP) and the superior preCS (SP) [7]. Between the IP and SP is a transverse gyrus that merges with the posterior part of the middle frontal gyrus. The width of the preCG is relatively larger in chimps, which is consistent with [6].
In humans, the CS and preCS are not exactly aligned, with the preCS being more ventral. This may be due to the higher operculation in humans.
The shape variability features expressed on each of the isomap dimensions for the chimp and human experiments are different. No axis exhibits left-right asymmetry. Chimp dimension1 shows a shortening of the ventral portion of the preCG while keeping the transverse gyrus of the preCG aligned with the knob of the hand; as well as a shift of the orientation of SP to the knob. Dimension2 represents the two parts of preCG moving towards the knob.
In humans, dimension1 corresponds to a narrowing of the gyrus dorsally while the hand area develops and a somatosensory knob aligned with the transverse gyrus appears. Dimension2 represents the transverse gyrus reaching the surface simultaneously with the development of a somatosensory knob in the same middle part of the preCG.
The dimension1 that describes the variability of chimps and humans mixed together, shows that they separate along the axis: humans have a dorsal knob and the transverse gyrus connects at the somatosensory knob, while in chimps the gyrus arrives at a more ventral knob.The preCG narrows in this same area.The dimension2 does not separate the species (p=0.10). The hand knob remains in dorsal position while the SP shrinks, no major change ventrally.
Their knob being more dorsal, humans seem to have a longer oro-facial area allowing more complex structures. The transverse gyrus is mainly aligned with the hand knob in chimps while aligned with a more ventral sensory knob in humans. This location may correspond to the midprCG, a region defined by neurosurgical investigations [8] and functionally located between dorsal hand and ventral orofacial cortical representations. Further work may benefit from the addition of fibers tracts and cytoarchitectonic to better understand what these folding variations may reflect.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic coupling modes (ICMs) can be observed in ongoing brain activity at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Two families of ICMs can be distinguished: phase and envelope ICMs. The principles that shape these ICMs remain partly elusive, in particular their relation to the underlying brain structure. Here we explored structure-function relationships in the ferret brain between ICMs quantified from ongoing brain activity recorded with chronically implanted micro-ECoG arrays and structural connectivity (SC) obtained from high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography. Large-scale computational models were used to explore the ability to predict both types of ICMs. Importantly, all investigations were conducted with ICM measures that are sensitive or insensitive to volume conduction effects. The results show that both types of ICMs are significantly related to SC, except for phase ICMs when using measures removing zero-lag coupling. The correlation between SC and ICMs increases with increasing frequency which is accompanied by reduced delays. Computational models produced results that were highly dependent on the specific parameter settings. The most consistent predictions were derived from measures solely based on SC. Overall, the results demonstrate that patterns of cortical functional coupling as reflected in both phase and envelope ICMs are both related, albeit to different degrees, to the underlying structural connectivity in the cerebral cortex.},

	abstract = {Objectifs : L'objectif de l'étude QSM4SENIOR (projet ESOC-Life H2020, www.eosc-life.eu) est de définir les
valeurs normales de la charge en fer du cerveau d'une population âgée de 55 à 80 ans par un
examen IRM et la mesure du biomarqueur innovant d'imagerie basé sur la cartographie
quantitative de la susceptibilité magnétique QSM (de Rochefort et al., MRM, 2010) dans la
matière grise profonde. Un rationnel scientifique fort existe entre accumulation de fer, QSM,
vieillissement cérébral et l’évolution de pathologies neurodégénératives (Ravanfar et al., Front.
Neurosci., 2021). Nous présentons ici les principales méthodes et les résultats du traitement
basé sur l'informatique dématérialisée dans l'infrastructure européenne de recherche de.NBI
cloud (www.denbi.de/cloud) ainsi que le contrôle qualité de ce biomarqueur d'imagerie.
Matériel et méthode : Les examens IRM ont été réalisé à ultra-haut champ (7T, Neurospin, CEA) de la cohorte SENIOR (Haeger et al, Alzheimers Res Ther., 2020) pour lesquels les cartes de QSM et R2* ont été
calculées. Les données relatives aux habitudes de vie telles que la consommation de tabac et
d'alcool, les comorbidités et les analyses sanguines ont été aussi exploitées. Une évaluation
neuropsychologique a été incluse au projet afin d’évaluer les capacités cognitives des patients.

Résultats : Nous avons montré que dans la population vieillissante de l’étude QSM4SENIOR, nous pouvions
détecter des variations significatives des biomarqueurs QSM et R2* dans différentes régions dans
la substance grise profonde sans que cela soit relié à des modifications de l'état de santé et du
mode de vie des personnes incluses dans la cohorte. En outre, nous avons démontré que les
biomarqueurs QSM et R2* sont complémentaires. Enfin, nous avons pu obtenir les valeurs
normales à 7T de QSM pour les personnes âgées de 55 à 80 ans dans différentes régions de la
substance grise profonde.

Conclusion : La robustesse de notre méthodologie, incluant un contrôle qualité adapté et via un traitement
automatisé sur une infrastructure « cloud » européenne de recherche a permis de définir les
valeurs normales du biomarqueur de la susceptibilité magnétique QSM sur la cohorte SENIOR.
Cette méthodologie permettra de fiabiliser les études multicentriques sur le sujet. Nous
envisageons l’interfaçage de ces outils avec les principales cohortes neurologiques afin
d'améliorer les études de recherche clinique impliquant des mesures IRM basées sur la
susceptibilité magnétique.},

Early diagnosis is crucial to enhance the patient’s quality of life through treatments and therapies. In this research, two white matter (WM) fiber bundle segmentation methods are analyzed and compared in terms of their performance and impact on the results obtained from the analyzes applied to a database comprising 37 adolescents, 19 subjects with autism and 18 controls. To achieve this, we conducted the segmentation of deep white matter tracts, and computed average diffusion-based indices for each tract, such as Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), Fractional Anisotropy (FA), and Generalized Fractional Anisotropy (GFA). We applied statistical tests to identify features with significant differences between groups based on the results of two segmentation methods. Significant differences in diffusion-based indices were found in certain cingulate, thalamic, corticospinal, and corpus callosum fascicles. Furthermore, we performed classification between patients and controls using each fascicle feature independently with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT) algorithms. Finally, we applied the classifiers to the most relevant features for each segmentation method. Overall, even with the limitations of our small database, we demonstrated that the segmentation algorithm has a high impact on WM tract-based analyzes and prediction, with the autocencoder-based algorithm showing better results than a distance-based method.},

To study brain dynamics, it is important to identify the cortical level of parcellation of greater metastability. This paper presents a new multiscale cortical parcellation method based on the geodesic distance between vertices of the cortical surface and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, starting from an anatomical parcellation. First, the centroids of each region are efficiently calculated using the geodesic distance between the region’s vertices. Then, an affinity graph is constructed between the region centroids, based on the geodesic distance, from which a dendrogram is constructed using hierarchical clustering. Finally, an adaptive tree partitioning method is employed to obtain parcellations at various granularity levels, producing a multiscale parcellation. Furthermore, we propose an optimized method for the calculation of structural connectomes for each parcellation level. This framework will be made available and can be applied to different fine-grained parcellations. Additional information, such as structural connectivity information can be easily added to the framework. In future work this multiscale cortical parcellation will allow for simulations of cerebral dynamics at different levels.},

              INTRODUCTION
              This study aims to examine whether physical activity moderates the association between biomarkers of brain pathologies and dementia risk.
            
            
              METHODS
              From the Memento cohort, we analyzed 1044 patients with mild cognitive impairment, aged 60 and older. Self‐reported physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Biomarkers of brain pathologies comprised medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), white matter lesions, and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 and phosphorylated tau181. Association between physical activity and risk of developing dementia over 5 years of follow‐up, and interactions with biomarkers of brain pathologies were tested.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Physical activity moderated the association between MTA and plasma Aβ42/40 level and increased dementia risk. Compared to participants with low physical activity, associations of both MTA and plasma Aβ42/40 on dementia risk were attenuated in participants with high physical activity.
            
            
              DISCUSSION
              Although reverse causality cannot be excluded, this work suggests that physical activity may contribute to cognitive reserve.

                    Physical activity is an interesting modifiable target for dementia prevention.

	abstract = {Human brain connectivity is extremely complex and variable across subjects. While long association and projection bundles are stable and have been deeply studied, short association bundles present higher inter-subject variability and few studies have been carried out to adequately describe the structure, shape and reproducibility of these bundles. However, their analysis is crucial in order to understand brain function and better characterize the human connectome. In this work, we propose an automatic method to identify reproducible short association bundles of the superficial white matter, based on inter-subject hierarchical clustering. The method is applied to the whole brain and finds representative clusters of similar fibers belonging to a group of subjects, according to a distance metric between fibers. We experimented with both affine and a non-linear registration and, due to better reproducibility, chose the results obtained from non-linear registration. Once the clusters are calculated, our method performs automatic labeling of the most stable connections based on individual cortical parcellations. We compare results between two independent groups of subjects from a HARDI database in order to generate reproducible connections for the creation of an atlas. To perform a better validation of the results, we used a bagging strategy that uses pairs of groups of 27 subjects from a database of 74 subjects. The result is an atlas with 44 bundles in the left hemisphere and 49 in the right hemisphere, of which 33 bundles are found in both hemispheres. Finally, we use the atlas to automatically segment 78 new subjects from a different HARDI database and analyze stability and lateralization results.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The association between circulating biomarkers of red blood cells (RBC) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on the brain MRI remains yet unclear. We investigated the cross-sectional and prospective associations of RBC omega-3 PUFAs with WMH in dementia-free older adults with subjective memory complaints.
Design
Participants were 234 older adults with assessments for both PUFA and MRI near to baseline; among them, 79 also had an MRI assessment at 3-year follow-up. The measurement of WMH volume was obtained by an automated segmentation algorithm. We related individual or combinational baseline RBC omega-3 PUFAs levels with baseline WMH volumes and WMH evolution over 3 years. We carried out multiple (cross-sectional) and mixed-effect (prospective analysis, with random effects at participant's level) linear regressions with adjustment for age, sex, time interval between date of blood draw for measurement of fatty acids and date of brain MRI, the status of APOE e4 carrier, body mass index, and vascular risk factors. Associations were considered significant at p â‰¤ 0.006 to take into account multiplicity (8 comparisons).
Results
None of the eight RBC omega-3 PUFAs tested was significantly associated with WMH at both cross-sectional and prospective analyses.
Conclusions
We did not find any association between omega-3 PUFAs and WMH in non-demented older adults with memory complaints. A longer longitudinal study with data on omega-3 PUFAs and WMH would contribute important information to this field.},

The free and cued selective reminding test is used to identify memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment and demented patients. It allows assessing three processes: encoding, storage, and recollection of verbal episodic memory.
Methods
We investigated the neural correlates of these three memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323 outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset, fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography evaluations.

Encoding was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally; retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal regions.
Discussion
The neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease remains to be studied.},

	abstract = {Because of the strong variability of the cortical sulci, their automatic recognition is still a challenging problem. The last algorithm developed in our laboratory for 125 sulci reaches an average recognition rate around 86\%. It has been applied to thousands of brains for morphometric studies (www.brainvisa.info). A weak point of this approach is the modeling of the training dataset as a single template of sulcus-wise probability maps, losing information about the alternative patterns of each sulcus. To overcome this limit, we propose a different strategy inspired by Multi-Atlas Segmentation (MAS) and more particularly the patch-based approaches. As the standard way of extracting patches does not seem capable of exploiting the sulci geometry and the relations between them, which we believe to be the discriminative features for recognition, we propose a new patch generation strategy based on a high level representation of the sulci. We show that our new approach is slightly, but significantly, better than the reference one, while we still have an avenue of potential refinements that were beyond reach for a single template strategy.},

Diffusion MRI experiments using oscillating gradient spin echo sequences have shown that the diffusivity transverse to axons in this extra-axonal space is dependent on the frequency of the employed sequence. In this study, we observe the same frequency-dependence using 3D simulations of the diffusion process in disordered media. We design a novel white matter numerical phantom generation algorithm which constructs biomimicking geometric configurations with few design parameters, and enables to control the level of disorder of the generated phantoms. The influence of various geometrical parameters present in white matter, such as global angular dispersion, tortuosity, presence of Ranvier nodes, beading, on the extra-cellular perpendicular diffusivity frequency dependence was investigated by simulating the diffusion process in numerical phantoms of increasing complexity and fitting the resulting simulated diffusion MR signal attenuation with an adequate analytical model designed for trapezoidal OGSE sequences. This work suggests that angular dispersion and especially beading have non-negligible effects on this extracellular diffusion metrics that may be measured using standard OGSE DW-MRI clinical protocols.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Since physical activity (PA) has demonstrated benefits for cardiovascular health, it is possible to hypothesize that higher or increasing PA slows the progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We investigated the association between PA and the progression of WMH in non-demented older adults with memory complaints.
Design
We included 152 participants (mean age 74.7Â±3.8 years; 63.8\% women) in the analyses, in whom information on self-reported PA and MRI was available at both baseline and 3-year follow-up. From the PA questionnaire, the baseline metabolic equivalent of task (MET-minute/week) and changes in MET-minute/week over three years were separately calculated for overall, leisure-time, and non-leisure time PA. WMH volume at baseline and 3-year follow-up was obtained by using an automated segmentation algorithm.
Results
Mixed-effect linear regression models showed that none of the baseline PA variables was associated with progression of WMH over time. People who had decreased their PA levels over three years tended to show greater progression of WMH compared with those who had maintained PA levels of â‰¥1200 MET-min/week (roughly equivalent to â‰¥300 minutes of brisk walking) in the unadjusted model (Î²Â±SE=4.85Â±2.42, p=0.045); however, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for confounders (Î²Â±SE =3.63Â±2.18, p=0.096).
Conclusions
We did not find any significant association between PA and WMH in non-demented older adults with memory complaints. However, decrease over time in PA levels tended to be associated with progression of WMH. A larger longitudinal study with data on PA assessed using objective measures would provide important information in this field.},

	abstract = {The influence of genes on cortical structures has been assessed through various phenotypes. The sulcal pits, which are the putative first cortical folds, have for long been assumed to be under tight genetic control, but this was never quantified. We estimated the pit depth heritability in various brain regions using the high quality and large sample size of the Human Connectome Project pedigree cohort. Analysis of additive genetic variance indicated that their heritability ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 and displays a regional genetic control with an overall symmetric pattern between hemispheres. However, a noticeable asymmetry of heritability estimates is observed in the superior temporal sulcus and could thus be related to language lateralization. The heritability range estimated in this study reinforces the idea that cortical shape is determined primarily by nongenetic factors, which is consistent with the important increase of cortical folding from birth to adult life and thus predominantly constrained by environmental factors. Nevertheless, the genetic cues, implicated with various local levels of heritability in the formation of sulcal pits, play a fundamental role in the normal gyral pattern development. Quantifying their influence and identifying the underlying genetic variants would provide insight into neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {The human hippocampus plays a key role in memory management and is one of the first structures affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging provides access to its inner structure in vivo. However, gradient limitations on clinical systems hinder access to its inner connectivity and microstructure. A major target of this paper is the demonstration of diffusion MRI potential, using ultra-high field (11.7 T) and strong gradients (750 mT/m), to reveal the extra- and intra-hippocampal connectivity in addition to its microstructure. To this purpose, a multiple-shell diffusion-weighted acquisition protocol was developed to reach an ultra-high spatio-angular resolution with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The MRI data set was analyzed using analytical Q-Ball Imaging, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging models. High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging estimates allowed us to obtain an accurate tractography resolving more complex fiber architecture than DTI models, and subsequently provided a map of the cross-regional connectivity. The neurite density was akin to that found in the histological literature, revealing the three hippocampal layers. Moreover, a gradient of connectivity and neurite density was observed between the anterior and the posterior part of the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that ex vivo ultra-high field/ultra-high gradients diffusion-weighted MRI allows the mapping of the inner connectivity of the human hippocampus, its microstructure, and to accurately reconstruct elements of the polysynaptic intra-hippocampal pathway using fiber tractography techniques at very high spatial/angular resolutions.},

Diagnostic relevance of plasma amyloid β (Aβ) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) process yields conflicting results. The objective of the study was to assess plasma levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nonamnestic MCI, and AD patients and to investigate relationships between peripheral and central biomarkers.
Methods
One thousand forty participants (417 amnestic MCI, 122 nonamnestic MCI, and 501 AD) from the Biomarker of AmyLoïd pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk multicenter prospective study with cognition, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging assessments were included.
Results
Plasma Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 were lower in AD (36.9 [11.7] and 263 [80] pg/mL) than in amnestic MCI (38.2 [11.9] and 269 [68] pg/mL) than in nonamnestic MCI (39.7 [10.5] and 272 [52] pg/mL), respectively (P = .01 for overall difference between groups for Aβ1–42 and P = .04 for Aβ1–40). Globally, plasma Aβ1–42 correlated with age, Mini–Mental State Examination, and APOE ε4 allele. Plasma Aβ1–42 correlated with all CSF biomarkers in MCI but only with CSF Aβ42 in AD.
Discussion
Plasma Aβ was associated with cognitive status and CSF biomarkers, suggesting the interest of plasma amyloid biomarkers for diagnosis purpose.},

The so-called superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP) area is observed from the last trimester of gestation onwards and is far less pronounced in the chimpanzee brain. This asymmetry is associated with more frequent sulcal interruptions, named plis de passage (PPs), leading to the irregular morphology of the left sulcus. In this paper, we aimed to characterize the variability, asymmetry, and heritability of these interruptions in the STS in comparison with the other main sulci. We developed an automated method to extract PPs across the cortex based on a highly reproducible grid of sulcal pits across individuals, which we applied to a subset of Human Connectome Project (HCP) subjects (N = 820). We report that only a few PPs across the cortex are genetically constrained, namely in the collateral, postcentral and superior temporal sulci and the calcarine fissure. Moreover, some PPs occur more often in one hemisphere than the other, namely in the precentral, postcentral, intraparietal sulci, as well as in both inferior and superior temporal sulci. Most importantly, we found that only the interruptions within the STAP region are both asymmetric and genetically constrained. Because this morphological pattern is located in an area of the left hemisphere related to speech, our results suggest structural constraints on the architecture of the linguistic network.},

A probabilistic description of the anatomical location and spatial variability of MTL cortices in the child and adolescent brain would help to assess structure-function relationships. The rhinal sulcus (RS) and the collateral sulcus (CS) that border MTL cortices and influence their morphology have never been described in these populations. In this study, we identified the aforementioned structures on magnetic resonance images of 38 healthy subjects aged 7-17 years old. Relative to sulcal morphometry in the MTL, we showed RS-CS conformation is an additional factor of variability in the MTL that is not explained by other variables such as age, sex and brain volume; with an innovative method using permutation testing of the extrema of structures of interest, we showed that RS-SC conformation was not associated with differences of location of MTL sulci. Relative to probabilistic maps, we offered for the first time a systematic mapping of MTL structures in children and adolescent, mapping all the structures of the MTL system while taking sulcal morphology into account. Our results, with the probabilistic maps described here being freely available for download, will help to understand the anatomy of this region and help functional and clinical studies to accurately test structure-function hypotheses in the MTL during development.},

This strategy stems from an approach called DISCO embedding sulcal constraints in a registration framework used to initialize DARTEL, the widely used spatial normalization approach proposed in the SPM software. We show that this strategy is efficient with a heterogeneous dataset including challenging data as preterm newborns, infants, post mortem histological data and a synthetic atlas computed from averaging the ICBM database, as well as more commonly studied data acquired in vivo in adults. We then describe some perspectives for a research program aiming at improving folding pattern matching for atlas inference in the context of the future HBP’s portal.},

	abstract = {The evolution of human-specific lateralised functions such as language has been linked to the development of structural asymmetries in the brain. Here we applied state of the art image analysis techniques to measure Sylvian Fissure (SF) asymmetry and Occipital Bending (OB) in 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the brain obtained in-vivo for 30 humans and 30 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). SF morphology differed between species, with the human SF terminating more superiorly in right inferior parietal lobe, an asymmetry that was on average absent in chimpanzees (F (1,52) = 5.963, p = 0.018). Irrespective of morphology, Total SF Length was, as previously reported, leftward in humans but not in chimpanzees, although the difference did not reach significance between species. However, when only brains possessing comparable bilateral SF bifurcation morphology were compared, humans showed previously reported “Typical” left-lateralised Anterior-Horizontal (AH-SF) and right-lateralised Vertical (V-SF) SF asymmetries. In contrast, chimpanzees lacked both asymmetries, and this approached being a significant difference between-species in the AH-SF segment (F (1, 34) = 3.680, p = 0.064). On average in humans the left occipital lobe crossed the midline toward the right (Rightward OB) which was significantly different from the chimpanzee cohort that showed no average OB (Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U Test, p = 0.012). Furthermore, OB was related to SF asymmetry in humans, such that the more rightward V-SF and leftward AH-SF, the more rightward the OB. This “Default” pattern of SF and OB asymmetries was found in 41.7\% of human individuals with bilateral SF bifurcation but none of the chimpanzees. To our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting that a pattern of SF and OB asymmetry distinguishes the human from the chimpanzee brain, and suggests this may be associated with a unique trajectory of brain development and functional abilities in humans.},

Since deviant gyrification patterns have been observed in many neurodevelopmental disorders, mapping cortical development in vivo from the early stages on is an essential step to uncover new markers for diagnosis or prognosis. Recently this has been made possible by MRI combined with post-processing tools, but the reported results are still fragmented. Here we aimed to characterize the typical folding progression ex utero from the pre- to the post-term period, by considering 58 healthy preterm and full-term newborns and infants imaged between 27 and 62 weeks of post-menstrual age. Using a method of spectral analysis of gyrification (SPANGY), we detailed the spatial-frequency structure of cortical patterns in a quantitative way. The modeling of developmental trajectories revealed three successive waves that might correspond to primary, secondary and tertiary folding. Some deviations were further detected in 10 premature infants without apparent neurological impairment and imaged at term equivalent age, suggesting that our approach is sensitive enough to highlight the subtle impact of preterm birth and extra-uterine life on folding.},

	abstract = {While the main neural networks are in place at term birth, intense changes in cortical microstructure occur during early infancy with the development of dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis and fiber myelination. These maturational processes are thought to relate to behavioral acquisitions and the development of cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, in vivo investigations of such relationships are still lacking in healthy infants. To bridge this gap, we aimed to study the cortical maturation using non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging, over a largely unexplored period (1–5 post-natal months). In a first univariate step, we focused on different quantitative parameters: longitudinal relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2), and axial diffusivity from diffusion tensor imaging (λ//) These individual maps, acquired with echo-planar imaging to limit the acquisition time, showed spatial distortions that were first corrected to reliably match the thin cortical ribbon identified on high-resolution T2-weighted images. Averaged maps were also computed over the infants group to summarize the parameter characteristics during early infancy. In a second step, we considered a multi-parametric approach that leverages parameters complementarity, avoids reliance on pre-defined regions of interest, and does not require spatial constraints. Our clustering strategy allowed us to group cortical voxels over all infants in 5 clusters with distinct microstructural T1 and λ// properties The cluster maps over individual cortical surfaces and over the group were in sound agreement with benchmark post mortem studies of sub-cortical white matter myelination, showing a progressive maturation of 1) primary sensori-motor areas, 2) adjacent unimodal associative cortices, and 3) higher-order associative regions. This study thus opens a consistent approach to study cortical maturation in vivo.},

The algorithm reaches high values of packing density and angular dispersion for the axonal fibers, even in the case of multiple white matter fiber populations and enables the construction of complex biomimicking geometries including myelinated axons, beaded axons, and glial cells.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}CADASIL is a monogenic small vessel disease characterized by the accumulation of brain tissue lesions of microvascular origin leading to strokes and cognitive deficits. Both cortical and parenchymal alterations have been described using various MRI markers. However, relationships between cortical and subcortical alterations remain largely unexplored. While brain atrophy is a preponderant feature in cerebral small vessel disease, recent results in CADASIL suggest slightly larger brain volumes and increased white matter water content at early stages of the disease by comparison to controls. We hypothesized in this study that increased water content in gyral white matter balances expected brain atrophy. Direct white matter volume computation is challenging in these patients given widespread subcortical alterations. Instead, our approach was that a gyral white matter swelling would translate into a modification of the shape of cortical gyri. Our goal was then to assess the relationship between subcortical lesions and possible alteration of the cortex shape. More specifically, aims of this work were to assess 1) morphometric differences of the cortex shape between CADASIL patients and controls 2) the relationship between the cortex shape and the volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), a reflect of white matter alterations. Twenty-one patients at the early stage of the disease and 28 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Cortical surfaces were reconstructed from 3D-T1-weighted images. Folding power assessed from spectral analysis of gyrification and cortical morphometry using curvedness and shape index were computed as proxies of the cortex shape. Influence of segmentation errors were evaluated through the simulation of WMH in controls. As a result, patients had larger folding power and curvedness compared to controls. They also presented lower shape indices both related to sulci and gyri. In patients, the volume of WMH was associated with decreased gyral shape index. These results suggest that the cortex shape of CADASIL patients is different compared to controls and that the enlargement of gyri is related to the extent of white matter alterations. The study of the cortex shape might be another way to evaluate subcortical swelling or atrophy in various neurological disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Diffusion MRI tractography offers the unique opportunity to investigate the
brain fiber architecture in vivo and noninvasively. However,
its reliability is still highly debated. Here, we explored the ability of
diffusion MRI tractography to match invasive anatomical tract-tracing
connectivity data of the ferret brain. We also investigated the influence of
several state-of-the-art tractography algorithms on this match to ground truth
connectivity data. Tract-tracing connectivity data were obtained from retrograde
tracer injections into the occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices of adult
ferrets. We found that the relative densities of projections identified from the
anatomical experiments were highly correlated with the estimates from all the
studied diffusion tractography algorithms (Spearman’s rho ranging from
0.67 to 0.91), while only small, nonsignificant variations appeared across the
tractography algorithms. These results are comparable to findings reported in
mouse and monkey, increasing the confidence in diffusion MRI tractography
results. Moreover, our results provide insights into the variations of
sensitivity and specificity of the tractography algorithms, and hence into the
influence of choosing one algorithm over another.In this article we used tract-tracing data as a gold standard to validate the use
of diffusion MRI tractography for inferring structural connectivity in the
ferret brain as well as for assessing the influence of several state-of-the-art
tractography algorithms on the inferred connections. We found high
correspondence between diffusion MRI tractography and tract-tracing with little
differences between the explored algorithms. We conclude that diffusion MRI
tractography provides a worthwhile whole-brain estimate of structural
connectivity that can be employed in further anatomical, developmental, and
computational studies of the ferret brain.},

However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from postmortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labeling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory, and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have been widely used to explore the associations between brain areas. Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often “static” despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time, moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity.},

We aimed to investigate the relevance of such an approach in AD, by exploring its (1) clinical relevance in comparison with traditional imaging methods, (2) relationship with amyloid deposition, (3) association with cognitive functions. Here, 51 patients (n = 32 mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia-AD, n = 19 moderate/severe dementia-AD) diagnosed according to clinical-biological criteria (CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET) and 29 controls (with negative amyloid-PET) underwent neuropsychological and 3T-MRI examinations. Mean sulcal width (SW) and mean cortical thickness around the sulcus (CT-S) were automatically measured. We found higher SW and lower CT-S in patients with AD than in controls. These differences were more pronounced at later stages of the disease and provided the best diagnostic accuracies among the imaging markers. Correlations were not found between CT-S or SW and amyloid deposition but between specific cognitive functions and regional CT-S/SW in key associated regions. Sulcal morphology is a good supporting diagnosis tool that reflects the main cognitive impairments in AD. It could be considered as a good surrogate marker to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs.},

	abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, autosomal dominant disorder that is characteristically thought of as a degenerative disorder. Despite cellular and molecular grounds suggesting HD could also impact normal development, there has been scarce systems-level data obtained from in vivo human studies supporting this hypothesis. Sulcus-specific morphometry analysis may help disentangle the contribution of coexisting neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental processes, but such an approach has never been used in HD. Here, we investigated cortical sulcal depth, related to degenerative process, as well as cortical sulcal length, related to developmental process, in early-stage HD and age-matched healthy controls. This morphometric analysis revealed significant differences in the HD participants compared with the healthy controls bilaterally in the central and intra-parietal sulcus, but also in the left intermediate frontal sulcus and calcarine fissure. As the primary visual cortex is not connected to the striatum, the latter result adds to the increasing in vivo evidence for primary cortical degeneration in HD. Those sulcal measures that differed between HD and healthy populations were mainly atrophy-related, showing shallower sulci in HD. Conversely, the sulcal morphometry also revealed a crucial difference in the imprint of the Sylvian fissure that could not be related to loss of grey matter volume: an absence of asymmetry in the length of this fissure in HD. Strong asymmetry in that cortical region is typically observed in healthy development. As the formation of the Sylvian fissure appears early in utero, and marked asymmetry is specifically found in this area of the neocortex in newborns, this novel finding likely indicates the foetal timing of a disease-specific, genetic interplay with neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess progression of semantic loss in early stages of cognitive decline using semantic and letter fluency performance, and its relation with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific neurodegeneration using longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging measures. Methods Change in verbal fluency was analyzed among 2261 non-demented individuals with a follow-up diagnosis of no mild cognitive impairment (MCI), amnestic MCI (aMCI), non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), or incident dementia, using linear mixed models across 4 years of follow-up, and relations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 1536) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose brain positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) imaging (n = 756) using linear regression models across 2 years of follow-up. Results Semantic fluency declined—fastest in those at higher risk for AD (apolipoprotein E [APOE] e4 carriers, Clinical Dementia Rating score of .5, aMCI, or incident dementia)—while letter fluency did not except for those with incident dementia. Lower baseline semantic fluency was associated with an increase in white matter hyperintensities and total mean cortical thinning over time, and regionally with less hippocampal volume as well as more cortical thinning and reduced 18F-FDG-PET uptake in the inferior parietal lobule, entorhinal cortex, isthmus cingulate, and precuneus–posterior cingulate area. In contrast, baseline letter fluency was not associated with change in total nor regional neurodegeneration. Whole-brain neurodegeneration over time was associated with faster decline in both fluencies, while AD-specific regions were associated with a faster rate of decline in semantic but not letter fluency. Interpretation This study provides strong evidence of distinctive degeneration of semantic abilities early on in relation to both cognitive decline and AD-specific neurodegeneration.},

However, the prospective association between WM integrity and frailty is still unclear. Our objectives were to measure associations between WM integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the 5-year worsening of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). SETTING Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS Participants (mean age = 74.7 ± 3.9 years) with no dementia at baseline who had functional magnetic resonance imaging performed as part of the MAPT study (n = 227). MEASUREMENTS Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were acquired for 10 different brain regions. Frailty was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype (score from 0 to 5, higher is worse) at up to seven time points for 5 years. Mixed effect ordinal logistic regression model was used to assess the prospective association between DTI parameters (independent variables) and frailty (dependent variable). All the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline total intracranial volume, and the presence of one of the following cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and/or hypercholesterolemia). RESULTS A statistically significant association was found between the RD, AxD, and MD for different brain regions (anterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, superior frontal occipital fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) and worsening of frailty over 5 years after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to show that WM integrity is associated with frailty in older adults. The mechanisms related to these results require further investigation.

	abstract = {We present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can give a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. Then, a parcellation algorithm is performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, it considers the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈ 0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈ 0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥ 0.5.},

	abstract = {Background
Several neurodegenerative markers measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown to be related with frailty. While most studies have focused on surrogates of cerebral vascular damage such as increased white matter lesions, the associations between cortical atrophy and frailty were less often investigated.
Objectives
To investigate the cross-sectional and prospective associations between cortical thickness and frailty evolution in older adults.
Methods
We enrolled 484 community-dwelling adults aged ≥70 years, participants from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), with data on cerebral cortical thickness and frailty. Cortical thickness was acquired by MRI for whole-brain and regional cortices. Two function-specific regions of interest, i.e., mobility-related regions and Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature, were selected on the basis of previous studies. Frailty status was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype (i.e., weakness, slowness, involuntary weight loss, fatigue and low physical activity level) at baseline, after 6 months and every year until the end of the 5-year follow-up.
Results
Older adults with higher global cortical thickness were less likely to be pre-frail and frail at baseline (adjusted OR: 0.13, 95\% CI: 0.03–0.65, p = 0.013). In addition, higher cortical thickness in mobility-related and AD-signature regions were associated with lower likelihood of being pre-frail and frail. Similar associations were observed for having weakness and slowness. However, neither global nor region-specific cortical thickness showed prospective associations with future frailty onset.
Conclusions
The global and regional cortical thickness cross-sectionally associated with frailty in older adults, but no prospective associations with incident frailty were found. The longitudinal relationship between cortical thickness and frailty evolution requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Automated methods that can identify white matter bundles from large tractography datasets have several applications in neuroscience research. In these applications, clustering algorithms have shown to play an important role in the analysis and visualization of white matter structure, generating useful data which can be the basis for further studies. This work proposes FFClust, an efficient fiber clustering method for large tractography datasets containing millions of fibers. Resulting clusters describe the whole set of main white matter fascicles present on an individual brain. The method aims to identify compact and homogeneous clusters, which enables several applications. In individuals, the clusters can be used to study the local connectivity in pathological brains, while at population level, the processing and analysis of reproducible bundles, and other post-processing algorithms can be carried out to study the brain connectivity and create new white matter bundle atlases. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of quality and execution time performance versus the state-of-the-art clustering techniques used in the area. Results show that FFClust is effective in the creation of compact clusters, with a low intra-cluster distance, while keeping a good quality Davies–Bouldin index, which is a metric that quantifies the quality of clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is about 8.6 times faster than the most efficient state-of-the-art method for one million fibers dataset. In addition, we show that FFClust is able to correctly identify atlas bundles connecting different brain regions, as an example of application and the utility of compact clusters.},

In Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics [1], we have recently published the first study showing increased neurite density in patients taking lithium with Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), an advanced model of MRI diffusion [2]. Albeit confirming previous results associating lithium with changes of grey matter volume [3], replication remains a priority in the field of neuroscience [4].Here, we report a replication of our previous results – higher neurite density within the left frontal cortex – in patients under lithium therapy compared with patients without lithium therapy, in a completely independent sample. Data were collected in Calgary (AB, Canada) from 23 controls and 26 patients with bipolar disorder upon which only 7 (26.9\%) were prescribed with lithium at the time of scan. MRI data were acquired with a General Electric MR750 3T device and included T1 structural MRI (MPRAGE, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm), and multi-shell, high angular resolution diffusion MRI (EPI, 96 × 96 × 60, voxel size: 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 mm), 98 gradient directions, 3 b-shells: b = 300, 700, and 2,000 mm2/s (8, 30, and 60 directions, respectively) and 10 b = 0 mm2/s images (1, 3, and 6 per shell, respectively). Both the MRI manufacturer and the diffusion weighted acquisition (number of directions, b values) were different from the original publication [1]. The sole measure of interest was the mean intracellular fraction within the left frontal cortex as defined by the Desikan-Killiany atlas [1].},

	abstract = {According to global neuronal workspace (GNW) theory, conscious access relies on long-distance cerebral connectivity to allow a global neuronal ignition coding for conscious content. In patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, both alterations in cerebral connectivity and an increased threshold for conscious perception have been reported. The implications of abnormal structural connectivity for disrupted conscious access and the relationship between these two deficits and psychopathology remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which structural connectivity is correlated with consciousness threshold, particularly in psychosis. We used a visual masking paradigm to measure consciousness threshold, and diffusion MRI tractography to assess structural connectivity in 97 humans of either sex with varying degrees of psychosis: healthy control subjects (n = 46), schizophrenia patients (n = 25), and bipolar disorder patients with (n = 17) and without (n = 9) a history of psychosis. Patients with psychosis (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic features) had an elevated masking threshold compared with control subjects and bipolar disorder patients without psychotic features. Masking threshold correlated negatively with the mean general fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts exclusively within the GNW network (inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, cingulum, and corpus callosum). Mediation analysis demonstrated that alterations in long-distance connectivity were associated with an increased masking threshold, which in turn was linked to psychotic symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that long-distance structural connectivity within the GNW plays a crucial role in conscious access, and that conscious access may mediate the association between impaired structural connectivity and psychosis.},

Our objectives were to evaluate the longitudinal association between kidney function and cognitive decline in older adults and to assess the involvement of cortical beta-amyloid and hippocampal atrophy (features of Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in this association. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). SETTINGS Thirteen memory centers (France and Monaco, 2008–2016). PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,334 community-dwellers {\textgreater}70 years old without dementia at baseline. MEASUREMENTS We estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine using CKD-Epi equation. Cognition was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months using a composite Z-score designed for MAPT. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score was used to assess cognition and functional independence. We examined the association between eGFR and (1) evolution of the composite cognitive Z-score using mixed-effect models and (2) progression on CDR using Cox models and mixed-effect models. Adjustments were made for age, sex, education, ApoE genotype, cardiovascular risk factors and disease, hippocampal volume (measured with magnetic resonance), and cortical beta-amyloid (measured with positron emission tomography). RESULTS Median (IQR) eGFR was 73(60–84) mL/min/1.73 m2. Two hundred sixty-nine participants experienced progression on CDR score during follow-up. eGFR{\textless}60 was significantly associated with progression on CDR score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.01–1.80) and with both the cognitive and functional independence components of CDR, but not with the evolution of the composite cognitive Z-score (adjusted β-coefficient −0.004, 95\% CI −0.014; 0.006). Associations were not modified after further adjustment for beta-amyloid (subsample: n = 252) and hippocampal volume (subsample: n = 270). CONCLUSIONS We did not find a mild to moderate renal insufficiency to be associated with brain imaging features of AD, and our results do not support the involvement of AD mechanisms in the incidence of cognitive impairment and functional decline associated with chronic kidney disease.},

              To explore associations between changes of lower extremity function (LEF) parameters over a 5‐year period and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of white matter tracts among community‐dwelling older adults.
            
            
              Design
              A secondary analysis on image and physical function data collected from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial (MAPT).
            
            
              Participants
              208 older adults (aged 75 ± 4 years, with spontaneous memory complaint or limited instrumental daily living activity or slow gait speed, 60\% female) of the MAPT‐magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study. The time interval between a participant's enrolment and MRI scan was on average 110 ± 97 days.
            
            
              Measurements
              Forty‐eight white matter tracts (WMTs) were measured. LEF parameters (measured after the MRI scan) were assessed as the short physical performance battery (SPPB) score, gait speed, and chair stands time over a 5‐year period. Mixed‐effects models were performed to explore the associations between baseline DTI values and the progression of LEF parameters. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparison correction.
            
            
              Results
              The progression of LEF was associated with 35 baseline DTI parameters from 24 WMTs. Higher baseline DTI parameter values were related to more decreases in SPPB score and gait speed, and greater increases in chair stands time. Bilateral uncinate fasciculus was associated with all LEF parameters. Other WMTs in cingulum, cerebral and cerebellar peduncle, internal capsule, and corpus callosum also showed close connections with LEF changes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings show that DTI parameters of some WMTs are associated with the 5‐year decline in LEF, suggesting that alterations in WMT integrity (evaluated by DTI parameters) might be used to explore potential causes of impaired mobility in older adults when no clear explanations can be found.},

However, the study of these fibers is still an incomplete task due to the high inter-subject variability and the size of this kind of fibers. In this work, a superficial white matter bundle identification based on fiber clustering was performed using probabilistic tractography on 100 subjects from the The Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, aligned with a non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering, followed by a segmentation of fibers connecting the precentral (PrC) and postcentral (PoC) regions, based on a ROI atlas. Due to the high amount of fibers, they were randomly separated into groups. An inter-subject clustering was applied on the fibers of each group, and then two clustering levels were applied to select the most reproducible bundles. Seven bundles per hemisphere were obtained, connecting the PrC and PoC regions. These were compared with bundles from previous atlases, showing in general more coverage and some bundles not found in previous atlases.},

Cortical and local GM volumes were compared using voxel-wise approaches with voxel-based morphometry and SIENAX using FSL. We used multiple linear regression models to test the influence of Li on cortical and local GM volumes, taking into account potential confounding factors such as a history of alcohol misuse.ResultsPatients taking Li had greater cortical GM volume than patients without. Patients undergoing Li had greater regional GM volumes in the right middle frontal gyrus, the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus in comparison with patients not taking Li.ConclusionsOur results in a large multicentric sample support the hypothesis that Li could exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects limiting pathological GM atrophy in key brain regions associated with BD.},

	abstract = {Post-mortem and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the central sulcus, as an indicator of motor cortex, have shown that in the general population there is greater representation of the dominant compared to the non-dominant hand. Studies of musicians, who are highly skilled in performing complex finger movements, have suggested this dominance is affected by musical training, but methods and findings have been mixed.In the present study, an automated image analysis pipeline using a 3D mesh approach was applied to measure central sulcus (CS) asymmetry on MR images obtained for a cohort of right-handed pianists and matched controls.The depth, length, and surface area (SA) of the CS and thickness of the cortical mantle adjacent to the CS were measured in each cerebral hemisphere by applying the BrainVISA Morphologist 2012 software pipeline to 3D T1-weighted MR images of the brain obtained for 15 right-handed pianists and 14 controls, matched with respect to age, sex, and handedness. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated for each parameter and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), and post hoc tests were performed to compare differences between the pianist and control groups.A one-way MANCOVA across the four AIs, controlling for age and sex, revealed a significant main effect of group (P = 0.04), and post hoc analysis revealed that while SA was significantly greater in the left than the right cerebral hemisphere in controls (P \&lt; 0.001), there was no significant difference between left and right SA in the pianists (P = 0.634). Independent samples t-tests revealed that the SA of right CS was significantly larger in pianists compared to controls (P = 0.015), with no between-group differences in left CS.Application of an image analysis pipeline to 3D MR images has provided robust evidence of significantly increased representation of the non-dominant hand in the brain of pianists compared to age-, sex-, and handedness-matched controls. This finding supports prior research showing structural differences in the central sulcus in musicians and is interpreted to reflect the long-term motor training and high skill level of right-handed pianists in using their left hand.},

	abstract = {The study of local cortical folding patterns showed links with psychiatric illnesses as well as cognitive functions. Despite the tools now available to visualize cortical folds in 3D, manually classifying local sulcal patterns is a time-consuming and tedious task. In fact, 3D visualization of folds helps experts to identify different sulcal patterns but fold variability is so high that the distinction between these patterns sometimes requires the definition of complex criteria, making manual classification difficult and not reliable. However, the assessment of the impact of these patterns on the functional organization of the cortex could benefit from the study of large databases, especially when studying rare patterns. In this paper, several algorithms for the automatic classification of fold patterns are proposed to allow morphological studies to be extended and confirmed on such large databases. Three methods are proposed, the first based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the second on the Scoring by Non-local Image Patch Estimator (SNIPE) approach and the third based on a 3D Convolution Neural Network (CNN). These methods are generic enough to be applicable to a wide range of folding patterns. They are tested on two types of patterns for which there is currently no method to automatically identify them: the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) patterns and the Power Button Sign (PBS). The two ACC patterns are almost equally present whereas PBS is a particularly rare pattern in the general population. The three models proposed achieve balanced accuracies of approximately 80\% for ACC patterns classification and 60\% for PBS classification. The CNN-based model is more interesting for the classification of ACC patterns thanks to its rapid execution. However, SVM and SNIPE-based models are more effective in managing unbalanced problems such as PBS recognition.},

	abstract = {Fiber clustering methods are typically used in brain research to study the organization of white matter bundles from large diffusion MRI tractography datasets. These methods enable exploratory bundle inspection using visualization and other methods that require identifying brain white matter structures in individuals or a population. Some applications, such as real-time visualization and inter-subject clustering, need fast and high-quality intra-subject clustering algorithms. This work proposes a parallel algorithm using a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) for fiber clustering based on the FFClust algorithm. The proposed GPGPU implementation exploits data parallelism using both multicore and GPU fine-grained parallelism present in commodity architectures, including current laptops and desktop computers. Our approach implements all FFClust steps in parallel, improving execution times in all of them. In addition, our parallel approach includes a parallel Kmeans++ algorithm implementation and defines a new variant of Kmeans++ to reduce the impact of choosing outliers as initial centroids. The results show that our approach provides clustering quality results very similar to FFClust, and it requires an execution time of 3.5 seconds for processing about a million fibers, achieving a speedup of 11.5 times compared to FFClust.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence supports that prenatal processes play an important role for cognitive ability in normal and clinical conditions. In this context, several neuroimaging studies searched for features in postnatal life that could serve as a proxy for earlier developmental events. A very interesting candidate is the sulcal, or sulco-gyral, patterns, macroscopic features of the cortex anatomy related to the fold topology - e.g. continuous vs interrupted/broken fold, present vs absent fold - or their spatial organization. Indeed, as opposed to quantitative features of the cortical sheet (e.g. thickness, surface area or curvature) taking decades to reach the levels measured in adult, the qualitative sulcal patterns are mainly determined before birth and stable across the lifespan. The sulcal patterns therefore offer a window on the fetal constraints on specific brain areas on cognitive abilities and clinical symptoms that manifest later in life. After a global review of the cerebral cortex sulcation, its mechanisms, its ontogenesis along with methodological issues on how to measure the sulcal patterns, we present a selection of studies illustrating that analysis of the sulcal patterns can provide information on prenatal dispositions to cognition (with a focus on cognitive control and academic abilities) and cognitive symptoms (with a focus on schizophrenia and bipolar disorders). Finally, perspectives of sulcal studies are discussed.},

Background
Physical activity (PA) has been shown to modulate the detrimental effect of carrying the apolipoprotein-E epsilon 4 (APOE-ɛ4) allele on brain structure. However, the current literature mainly provides cross-sectional data, and longitudinal studies investigating the interaction between genotype and PA on white matter (WM) integrity are lacking.
Objectives
We investigated both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal interactive effects of APOE-ɛ4 and PA on WM integrity in older adults.
Methods
Fractional anisotropy, as well as axial, radial, and mean diffusivity, extracted from brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to assess WM integrity in non-demented older adults. They were categorized according to their APOE-ɛ4 status (carriers vs. non-carriers), and their level of total (TPA), moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and light (LPA) PA were assessed using a questionnaire. Mixed model regressions were performed to test the interactive effects of APOE-ɛ4 status and PA on WM integrity at baseline and over a 3-year follow-up.
Results
190 subjects with a mean age 74.5 years (SD = 3.9) were examined. Despite a lack of cross-sectional associations, sensitivity analyses revealed that, in the carrier group only, higher levels of LPA, but not MVPA, were mainly associated with higher axial and mean diffusivity values over time.
Conclusions
This study partially confirms the previously reported interactive associations between PA, APOE-ɛ4 genotype and WM integrity, supporting the hypothesis that PA may protect against fiber loss in WM tracts containing crossing fibers. Future studies assessing sedentary behaviors in addition to PA could bring relevant contributions to the field.

	abstract = {We are interested here in the central organ of our thoughts: the brain. Advances in neuroscience have made it possible to obtain increasing information on the anatomy of this organ, at ever-higher resolutions, with different imaging techniques, on ever-larger samples. At the same time, paleoanthropology has to deal with partial reflections on the shape of the brain, on fragmentary specimens and small samples in an attempt to approach the morphology of the brain of past human species. It undeniably emerges from the perspective we propose here that paleoanthropology has much to gain from interacting more with the field of neuroimaging. Improving our understanding of the morphology of the endocast necessarily involves studying the external surface of the brain and the link it maintains with the internal surface of the skull. The contribution of neuroimaging will allow us to better define the relationship between brain and endocast. Models of intra- and inter-species variability in brain morphology inferred from large neuroimaging databases will help make the most of the rare endocasts of extinct species. We also conclude that exchanges between these two disciplines will also be beneficial to our knowledge of the Homo sapiens brain. Documenting the anatomy among other human species and including the variation over time within our own species are approaches that offer us a new perspective through which to appreciate what really characterizes the brain of humanity today.},

	abstract = {White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.},

Participants who progressed to frailty during the 5-year follow-up were categorized as “incident frailty” and those who remained non-frail were categorized as “without frailty.” The differences of baseline biochemical factors (25-hydroxyvitamin D, homocysteine, omega-3 index, C-reactive protein), other biological markers (Apolipoprotein E genotypes, amyloid-β deposits), and neuroimaging data (gray matter volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities) were compared between groups. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the associations between biomarkers and incident frailty.A total of 195 participants (14.0\%) became frail over 5 years. Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, homocysteine levels, low-grade inflammation (persistently increased C-reactive protein 3–10 mg/L), gray matter, and hippocampal volume were significantly associated with incident frailty in unadjusted models, these associations disappeared after adjustment for age, sex, and other confounders. Omega-3 index was the sole marker that presented a trend of association with incident frailty (hazard ratio: 0.92; 95\% confidence interval: 0.83–1.01; p = .082).This study failed to identify biomarkers able to predict frailty incidence in community-dwelling older adults for a period of 5 years. Further longitudinal research with multiple measurements of biomarkers and frailty is needed to evaluate the long-term relationships between changes in biomarkers levels and frailty evolution.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced algorithm for automatic segmentation of superficial white matter (SWM) bundles from probabilistic dMRI tractography datasets, based on a multi-subject bundle atlas. Previous segmentation methods use the maximum Euclidean distance between corresponding points of the subject fibers and the atlas centroids. However, this scheme might include noisy fibers. Here, we propose a three step approach to discard noisy fibers improving the identification of fibers. The first step applies a fiber clustering and the segmentation is performed between the centroids of the clusters and the atlas centroids. This step removes outliers and enables a better identification of fibers with similar shapes. The second step applies a fiber filter based on two different fiber similarities. One is the Symmetrized Segment-Path Distance (SSPD) over 2D ISOMAP and the other is an adapted version of SSPD for 3D space. The last step eliminates noisy fibers by removing those that connect regions that are far from the main atlas bundle connections. We perform an experimental evaluation using ten subjects of the Human Connectome (HCP) database. The evaluation only considers the bundles connecting precentral and postcentral gyri, with a total of seven bundles per hemisphere. For comparison, the bundles of the ten subjects were manually segmented. Bundles segmented with our method were evaluated in terms of similarity to manually segmented bundles and the final number of fibers. The results show that our approach obtains bundles with a higher similarity score than the state-of-the-art method and maintains a similar number of fibers.Clinical relevance—Many brain pathologies or disorders can occur in specific regions of the SWM automatic segmentation of reliable SWM bundles would help applications to clinical research.},

Results Patients with SZ showed a smaller global cerebellar gray matter volume compared to controls, with most of the changes located to the cognitive part of the cerebellum (Crus II and lobule VIIb). This decrease was present in the subgroup of patients with recent-onset SZ. We did not find any alterations in the cerebellum in patients with BD. However, patients medicated with lithium had a larger size of the anterior cerebellum, compared to patients not treated with lithium.

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the role of biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD), neurodegeneration, and small vessel disease (SVD) as mediators in the association between diabetes mellitus and cognition.
Methods
The study sample was derived from MEMENTO, a cohort of French adults recruited in memory clinics and screened for either isolated subjective cognitive complaints or mild cognitive impairment. Diabetes was defined based on blood glucose assessment, use of antidiabetic agent, or self-report. We used structural equation modeling to assess whether latent variables of AD pathology (PET mean amyloid uptake, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and CSF phosphorylated tau), SVD (white matter hyperintensities volume and visual grading), and neurodegeneration (mean cortical thickness, brain parenchymal fraction, hippocampal volume, and mean fluorodeoxyglucose uptake) mediate the association between diabetes and a latent variable of cognition (5 neuropsychological tests), adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
There were 254 (11.1\%) participants with diabetes among 2,288 participants (median age 71.6 years; 61.8\% women). The association between diabetes and lower cognition was significantly mediated by higher neurodegeneration (standardized indirect effect: −0.061, 95\% confidence interval: −0.089, −0.032), but not mediated by SVD and AD markers. Results were similar when considering latent variables of memory or executive functioning.
Conclusion
In a large clinical cohort in the elderly, diabetes is associated with lower cognition through neurodegeneration, independently of SVD and AD biomarkers.},

They are invaluable resources to study the influence of genetics and environment in the brain features variance observed in normal and pathological populations. This study presents a genome-wide haplotype analysis for 123 brain sulcus opening value (a measure of sulcal width) across the whole brain that include 16,304 subjects from UK Biobank. Using genetic maps, we defined 119,548 blocks of low recombination rate distributed along the 22 autosomal chromosomes and analyzed 1,051,316 haplotypes. To test associations between haplotypes and complex traits, we designed three statistical approaches. Two of them use a model that includes all the haplotypes for a single block, while the last approach considers each haplotype independently. All the statistics produced were assessed as rigorously as possible. Thanks to the rich imaging dataset at hand, we used resampling techniques to assess False Positive Rate for each statistical approach in a genome-wide and brain-wide context. The results on real data show that genome-wide haplotype analyses are more sensitive than single-SNP approach and account for local complex Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) structure, which makes genome-wide haplotype analysis an interesting and statistically sound alternative to the single-SNP counterpart.},

However, the relationship between grey matter volume and cellular microstructural changes is not straightforward, as modifications of different cellular compartments of grey matter may be involved. Objectives: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that dendritic density is higher in patients undergoing lithium therapy than in patients without lithium, using advanced modelling of water diffusion investigated with MRI. Method: We included 41 patients and 40 controls matched for age and gender from two sites. All subjects underwent 3T MRI with 3 shells of diffusion. We used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging to compare the grey matter neurite density between patients undergoing lithium therapy or not and control subjects. Results: We found a significant group effect in the left prefrontal region (p = 0.001, Bonferroni corrected): patients without lithium had a lower frontal neurite density than controls (p = 0.009), while those on lithium had a higher mean neurite density than those without (p \&lt; 0.001). Patients on lithium were not different from controls (p = 0.08). Conclusions: This is the first study to report in vivo evidence of preserved neurite density of the prefrontal cortex in humans associated with lithium intake. Changes of intracellular volume fraction are thought to reflect changes of grey matter microstructural organization. This reinforces the hypothesis of lithium having a positive effect on the neuronal compartment in humans.},

	abstract = {Background
Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are known to be associated with better white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in older adults in cross-sectional studies. However, no studies have investigated the association between PA levels and the evolution of DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity).
Objectives
To examine the cross-sectional associations between PA levels and DTI parameters, then to investigate the association between baseline PA levels and the evolution of DTI parameters in older adults.
Methods
Data on magnetic resonance imaging with DTI method from the Multidomain Alzheimer’s Preventive Trial (MAPT) study were used; 228 participants had data on DTI measured at three time-points over five years. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were acquired for six different brain regions.
Results
No significant associations were found in the cross-sectional analyses. Only one association was found: compared with active individuals, a faster worsening in the mean diffusivity of the uncinate fasciculus region was found in inactive individuals (-5.0 × 10-6 (-9.5 × 10-5, 4.9 × 10-6)).
Conclusions
In this study, we found that the condition of the uncinate fasciculus region may be susceptible to changes in PA levels in older adults. Longitudinal studies that assess fitness and PA using objective measurements (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness and accelerometry) could shed some new light on this topic.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective
Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) have consistently proven to be associated with CSF or PET biomarkers and effectively discriminate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to test their utility in clinical practice, from a multicentric unselected prospective cohort where patients presented with a large spectrum of cognitive deficits or complaints.
Methods
The MEMENTO cohort enrolled 2,323 outpatients with subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) consulting in 26 French memory clinics. Participants had neuropsychological assessments, MRI, and blood sampling at baseline. CSF sampling and amyloid PET were optional. Baseline blood Aβ42/40 ratio, total tau, p181-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a Simoa HD-X analyzer. An expert committee validated incident dementia cases during a 5-year follow-up period.
Results
Overall, 2,277 individuals had at least 1 baseline blood biomarker available (n = 357 for CSF subsample, n = 649 for PET subsample), among whom 257 were diagnosed with clinical AD/mixed dementia during follow-up. All blood biomarkers but total tau were mildly correlated with their equivalence in the CSF (r = 0.33 to 0.46, p {\textless} 0.0001) and were associated with amyloid-PET status (p {\textless} 0.0001). Blood p181-tau was the best blood biomarker to identify amyloid-PET positivity (area under the curve = 0.74 [95\% CI = 0.69; 0.79]). Higher blood and CSF p181-tau and NfL concentrations were associated with accelerated time to AD dementia onset with similar incidence rates, whereas blood Aβ42/40 was less efficient than CSF Aβ42/40. Blood p181-tau alone was the best blood predictor of 5-year AD/mixed dementia risk (c-index = 0.73 [95\% CI = 0.69; 0.77]); its accuracy was higher in patients with clinical dementia rating (CDR) = 0 (c-index = 0.83 [95\% CI = 0.69; 0.97]) than in patients with CDR = 0.5 (c-index = 0.70 [95\% CI = 0.66; 0.74]). A “clinical” reference model (combining demographics and neuropsychological assessment) predicted AD/mixed dementia risk with a c-index = 0.88 [95\% CI = 0.86–0.91] and performance increased to 0.90 [95\% CI = 0.88; 0.92] when adding blood p181-tau + Aβ42/40. A “research” reference model (clinical model + apolipoprotein E genotype and AD signature on MRI) had a c-index = 0.91 [95\% CI = 0.89–0.93] increasing to 0.92 [95\% CI = 0.90; 0.93] when adding blood p181-tau + Aβ42/40. Chronic kidney disease and vascular comorbidities did not affect predictive performances.
Discussion
In a clinic-based cohort of patients with SCC or MCI, blood biomarkers may be good hallmarks of underlying pathology but add little to 5-year dementia risk prediction models including traditional predictors.},

Several studies have investigated the impact of reading on the brain, and particularly how the anatomy of the brain changes with reading acquisition. In the present study, we investigated the converse issue, namely whether and how reading acquisition is constrained by the anatomy of the brain. Using multimodal MRI, we found that (a) the pattern (continuous or interrupted sulcus) of the posterior part of the left lateral occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS) hosting the visual word form area (VWFA) predicts reading skills in adults; that (b) this effect is modulated by the age of reading acquisition; and that (c) the length of the OTS sulcal interruption is associated with reading skills. Because the sulcal pattern is determined in utero, our findings suggest that individual difference in reading skills can be traced back to early stages of brain development in addition to the well-established socioeconomic and educational factors.},

The superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP), which is not observed in chimpanzees, represents an ideal phenotype to investigate the genetic variations that support human communication. The left STAP depth was significantly associated with a predicted enhancer annotation located in the 14q23.1 locus, between DACT1 and KIAA0586, in the UK Biobank British discovery sample (N = 16 515). This association was replicated in the IMAGEN cohort (N = 1726) and the UK Biobank non-British validation sample (N = 2161). This genomic region was also associated to a lesser extent with the right STAP depth and the formation of sulcal interruptions, “plis de passage,” in the bilateral STAP but not with other structural brain MRI phenotypes, highlighting its notable association with the superior temporal regions. Diffusion MRI emphasized an association with the fractional anisotropy of the left auditory fibers of the corpus callosum and with networks involved in linguistic processing in resting-state functional MRI. Overall, this evidence demonstrates a specific relationship between this locus and the establishment of the superior temporal regions that support human communication.},

We divided all individuals genetically confirmed of British ancestry into two sub-cohorts (12,162 and 3435 subjects for discovery and replication samples, respectively). We found that the heritability of the sulcal opening ranges from 15 to 45\% (SE = 4.8\%). We identified 4 new loci that contribute to this opening, including one that also affects the sulci grey matter thickness. We identified the most significant variant (rs864736) on this locus as being an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the KCNK2 gene. This gene regulates the immune-cell into the central nervous system (CNS) and controls the CNS inflammation, which is implicated in cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic contribution to cortical shrinking and promote further investigation into these variants and genes in pathological context such as Alzheimer’s disease in which brain shrinkage is a key biomarker.},
