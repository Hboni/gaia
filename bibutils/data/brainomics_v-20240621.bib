	abstract = {Hundreds of genetic loci participate to schizophrenia liability. It is also known that impaired cerebral connectivity is directly related to the cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia. How genetic susceptibility and brain neural networks interact to specify a pathological phenotype in schizophrenia remains elusive. Imaging genetics, highlighting brain variations, has proven effective to establish links between vulnerability loci and associated clinical traits. As previous imaging genetics works in schizophrenia have essentially focused on structural DNA variants, these findings could be blurred by epigenetic mechanisms taking place during gene expression. We explored the meaningful links between genetic data from peripheral blood tissues on one hand, and regional brain reactivity to emotion task assayed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging on the other hand, in schizophrenia patients and matched healthy volunteers. We applied Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis to identify joint signals between two blocks of variables: (i) the transcriptional expression of 33 candidate genes, and (ii) the blood oxygen level-dependent activity in 16 region of interest. Results suggested that peripheral transcriptional expression is related to brain imaging variations through a sequential pathway, ending with the schizophrenia phenotype. Generalization of such an approach to larger data sets should thus help in outlining the pathways involved in psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.
IMAGING: SEARCHING FOR LINKS TO AID DIAGNOSIS: Researchers explore links between the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia in blood cells and variations in brain activity during emotion processing. El Chérif Ibrahim and Eric Fakra at Aix-Marseille Université, France, and colleagues have developed a method to relate the expression levels of 33 schizophrenia susceptibility genes in blood cells and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained as individuals carry out a task that triggers emotional responses. Although they found no significant differences in the expression of genes between the 26 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls they examined, variations in activity in the superior temporal gyrus were strongly linked to schizophrenia-associated gene expression and presence of disease. Similar analyses of larger data sets will shed further light on the relationship between peripheral molecular changes and disease-related behaviors and ultimately, aid the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disease.},

Methods recently developed claim that they allow simultaneously to link the computed model to the graphical structure of the data set and to select a handful of important features in the analysis. However, there is still no way to simulate data for which we can separate the three properties that such method claim to achieve. These properties are: (i) the sparsity of the solution, i.e., the fact the the model is based on a few features of the data; (ii) the structure of the model; (iii) the relation between the structure of the model and the graphical model behind the generation of the data.},

However, extensive characterization of IHI in a large sample has not yet been performed. Furthermore, it is unclear whether IHI are restricted to the medial-temporal lobe or are associated with more extensive anatomical changes. Here, we studied the characteristics of IHI in a community based sample of 2008 subjects of the IMAGEN database and their association with extra-hippocampal anatomical variations. The presence of IHI was assessed on Ti-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed the association of IHI with other anatomical changes throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent in the left hippocampus (left: 17\%, right: 6\%, chi(2) - test, p {\textless} 10(-28)). Compared to subjects without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe. Our results demonstrate that IHI are a common left-sided phenomenon in normal subjects and that they are associated with morphological changes outside the medial temporal lobe.},

	abstract = {Cannabis use in adolescence may be characterized by differences in the neural basis of affective processing. In this study, we used an fMRI affective face processing task to compare a large group (n = 70) of 14-year olds with a history of cannabis use to a group (n = 70) of never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after excluding subjects with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence may place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Anew simple method is proposed to detect, using PET and [(11)C]raclopride, changes in striatal extracellular dopamine concentration during a rewarded effortful task. This approach aimed to increase the sensitivity in detection of these effects. It requires a single-dynamic PET study and combines the classic kinetic compartmental model with the general linear model of SPM to provide statistical inference on changes in [(11)C]raclopride time-activity curve due to endogenous dopamine release during two short periods of activation. Kinetic simulations predicted that 100\% dopamine increase during two 5- min periods starting at 30 and 60 min after the injection can be detected. Moreover the effects of dopamine release on the [(11)C]raclopride time-activity-curve are different from those induced by CBF increase. These simulated curves were used to construct the statistical linear model and to test voxel-by-voxel in healthy subjects the hypothesis that dopamine is released in the ventral striatum during periods of unexpected monetary gains, but not during periods of unexpected monetary loss. The experimental results are in line with the expected results although the amplitude of the effects due to dopamine release is moderate. The advantages and the limits of this method as well as the relevance of the results for dopamine involvement in reward processing are discussed.},

They then tested whether these alterations are specific to anhedonia as compared with low mood and whether they are predictive of depressive outcomes. Method: Functional MRI was used to collect blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to anticipation of reward in the monetary incentive task in 1,576 adolescents in a community-based sample. Adolescents with current subthreshold depression and clinical depression were compared with matched healthy subjects. In addition, BOLD responses were compared across adolescents with anhedonia, low mood, or both symptoms, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: Activity in the ventral striatum was reduced in participants with subthreshold and clinical depression relative to healthy comparison subjects. Low ventral striatum activation predicted transition to subthreshold or clinical depression in previously healthy adolescents at 2-year follow-up. Brain responses during reward anticipation decreased in a graded manner between healthy adolescents, adolescents with current or future subthreshold depression, and adolescents with current or future clinical depression. Low ventral striatum activity was associated with anhedonia but not low mood; however, the combined presence of both symptoms showed the strongest reductions in the ventral striatum in all analyses. Conclusions: The findings suggest that reduced striatal activation operates as a mechanism across the risk spectrum for depression. It is associated with anhedonia in healthy adolescents and is a behavioral indicator of positive valence systems, consistent with predictions based on the Research Domain Criteria.},

	abstract = {The processing of emotional faces is an important prerequisite for adequate social interactions in daily life, and might thus specifically be altered in adolescence, a period marked by significant changes in social emotional processing. Previous research has shown that the cannabinoid receptor CB1R is associated with longer gaze duration and increased brain responses in the striatum to happy faces in adults, yet, for adolescents, it is not clear whether an association between CBR1 and face processing exists. In the present study we investigated genetic effects of the two CB1R polymorphisms, rs1049353 and rs806377, on the processing of emotional faces in healthy adolescents. They participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Faces Task, watching blocks of video clips with angry and neutral facial expressions, and completed a Morphed Faces Task in the laboratory where they looked at different facial expressions that switched from anger to fear or sadness or from happiness to fear or sadness, and labelled them according to these four emotional expressions. A-allele versus GG-carriers in rs1049353 displayed earlier recognition of facial expressions changing from anger to sadness or fear, but not for expressions changing from happiness to sadness or fear, and higher brain responses to angry, but not neutral, faces in the amygdala and insula. For rs806377 no significant effects emerged. This suggests that rs1049353 is involved in the processing of negative facial expressions with relation to anger in adolescence. These findings add to our understanding of social emotion-related mechanisms in this life period.},

Patients with affective flattening and psychomotor retardation had [(18)F]dopa K(i) decreases in the left caudate, bilateral putamen and nucleus accumbens, left parahippocampus and dorsal brainstem. Impulsive depressives had [(18)F]dopa K(i) decreases in the anterior cingulate and hypothalamus, and an increase in the right parahippocampal gyrus.

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful tool for pharmacokinetics studies in rodents during the preclinical phase of drug and tracer development. However, rodent organs are small as compared to the scanner's intrinsic resolution and are affected by physiological movements. We present a new method for the segmentation of rodent whole-body PET images that takes these two difficulties into account by estimating the pharmacokinetics far from organ borders. The segmentation method proved efficient on whole-body numerical rat phantom simulations, including 3-14 organs, together with physiological movements (heart beating, breathing, and bladder filling). The method was resistant to spillover and physiological movements, while other methods failed to obtain a correct segmentation. The radioactivity concentrations calculated with this method also showed an excellent correlation with the manual delineation of organs in a large set of preclinical images. In addition, it was faster, detected more organs, and extracted organs' mean time activity curves with a better confidence on the measure than manual delineation.},

	abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach.},

	abstract = {Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images for diagnosis of a clinical condition. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV) enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.},

	abstract = {PET scanners devoted to in vivo functional study have recently been developed, but autoradiography remains the reference technique for assessing cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRGlu) in rodents. Autoradiographs are conventionally subjected to region of interest (ROI) analysis, which is intrinsically hypothesis-driven and therefore not suitable for whole-brain investigation. Voxel-wise statistical methods of analysis have long been used to determine differences in brain activity during in vivo functional neuroimaging experiments. They have also recently been applied to 3D reconstructed autoradiographic volume images from rat brains. We present here a fully automated analysis for autoradiographic data combining (1) computerized procedures for the acquisition and 3D reconstruction of postmortem volume images and (2) spatial normalization followed by classical whole-brain voxel-wise statistical analysis. We also describe an additional procedure for characterizing functional differences between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. We compared two spatial normalization techniques and evaluated how the effect of choosing a particular normalization technique impacted on the statistical analysis. We also propose a small volume correction analysis to address the problem of multiple statistical comparisons. Lastly, we investigated the reliability of such analyses, by comparing their results qualitatively and quantitatively with those previously obtained with our semiautomated ROI-based analysis [Dubois, A., Dauguet, J., Herard, A.-S., Besret, L., Duchesnay, E., Frouin, V., Hantraye, P., Bonvento, G., Delzescaux, T., 2007. Automated three-dimensional analysis of histologic and autoradiographic rat brain sections: application to an activation study. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 27 (10), 1742-1755.]. Both voxel-wise statistical analyses led to the detection of consistent interhemispheric differences in CMRGlu. This work demonstrates the potential value and robustness of voxel-wise statistical methods for analyzing autoradiographic data sets.},

	abstract = {Children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) need new and more efficient treatments. They can be developed at relapse or at diagnosis, but therefore they must be combined with radiotherapy. Survival of children after recurrence and its predictors were studied to inform the possibility to design early phase clinical trials for DIPG at this stage. Among 142 DIPG patients treated between 1998 and 2014, 114 had biopsy-proven DIPG with histone H3 status available for 83. We defined as long survivors' patients who survived more than 3 months after relapse which corresponds to the minimal life expectancy requested for phase I/II trials. Factors influencing post-relapse survival were accordingly compared between short and long-term survivors after relapse. Fifty-seven percent of patients were considered long survivors and 70\% of them had a Lansky Play Scale (LPS) above 50\% at relapse. Patients who became steroids-independent after initial treatment for at least 2 months had better survival after relapse (3.7 versus 2.6 months, p = 0.001). LPS above 50\% at relapse was correlated with better survival after relapse (3.8 versus 1.8 months, p {\textless} 0.001). Patients with H3.1 mutation survived longer after relapse (4.9 versus 2.7 months, p = 0.007). Patients who received a second radiotherapy at the time of relapse had an improved survival (7.5 versus 4 months, p = 0.001). In the two-way ANOVA analysis, steroid-independence and LPS predicted survival best and the type of histone H3 (H3.1 or H3.3) mutated did not improve prediction. Survival of many DIPG patients after relapse over 3 months would make possible to propose specific trials for this condition. Steroid-independence, H3 mutation status and LPS should be considered to predict eligibility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The tremendous clinical and aetiological diversity among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been a major obstacle to the development of new treatments, as many may only be effective in particular subgroups. Precision medicine approaches aim to overcome this challenge by combining pathophysiologically based treatments with stratification biomarkers that predict which treatment may be most beneficial for particular individuals. However, so far, we have no single validated stratification biomarker for ASD. This may be due to the fact that most research studies primarily have focused on the identification of mean case-control differences, rather than within-group variability, and included small samples that were underpowered for stratification approaches. The EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) is to date the largest multi-centre, multi-disciplinary observational study worldwide that aims to identify and validate stratification biomarkers for ASD.
METHODS: LEAP includes 437 children and adults with ASD and 300 individuals with typical development or mild intellectual disability. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, each participant is comprehensively characterised in terms of clinical symptoms, comorbidities, functional outcomes, neurocognitive profile, brain structure and function, biochemical markers and genomics. In addition, 51 twin-pairs (of which 36 had one sibling with ASD) are included to identify genetic and environmental factors in phenotypic variability.
RESULTS: Here, we describe the demographic characteristics of the cohort, planned analytic stratification approaches, criteria and steps to validate candidate stratification markers, pre-registration procedures to increase transparency, standardisation and data robustness across all analyses, and share some 'lessons learnt'. A clinical characterisation of the cohort is given in the companion paper (Charman et al., accepted).
CONCLUSION: We expect that LEAP will enable us to confirm, reject and refine current hypotheses of neurocognitive/neurobiological abnormalities, identify biologically and clinically meaningful ASD subgroups, and help us map phenotypic heterogeneity to different aetiologies.},

The images from department A were smoothed using a gaussian filter to mimic data from a third department (department A-S). The primary lesion was segmented to obtain a lesion volume of interest (VOI), and a spheric VOI was set in healthy liver tissue. Three SUVs and 6 textural features were computed in all VOIs. A harmonization method initially described for genomic data was used to estimate the department effect based on the observed feature values. Feature distributions in each department were compared before and after harmonization. Results: In healthy liver tissue, the distributions significantly differed for 4 of 9 features between departments A and B and for 6 of 9 between departments A and A-S (P {\textless} 0.05, Wilcoxon test). After harmonization, none of the 9 feature distributions significantly differed between 2 departments (P {\textgreater} 0.1). The same trend was observed in lesions, with a realignment of feature distributions between the departments after harmonization. Identification of TN lesions was largely enhanced after harmonization when the cutoffs were determined on data from one department and applied to data from the other department. Conclusion: The proposed harmonization method is efficient at removing the multicenter effect for textural features and SUVs. The method is easy to use, retains biologic variations not related to a center effect, and does not require any feature recalculation. Such harmonization allows for multicenter studies and for external validation of radiomic models or cutoffs and should facilitate the use of radiomic models in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., -dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.},

	abstract = {Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images to decode cognitive states or diagnosis/prognosis of a clinical condition/evolution. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total variation (TV) is a promising candidate for structured penalization: it enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties. However, reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed to unacceptable levels. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed toward any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the To propose an expression of the duality convergence speed. This expression is applicable to many penalties and can be used with other solvers than CONESTA. We also propose an expression for the particular smoothing parameter that minimizes the number of iterations required to reach a given precision. Furthermore, we provide a convergence proof and its rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.},

	abstract = {The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (ℓ2 penalty) or scattered (ℓ1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of ℓ1, ℓ2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact ℓ1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions.},

	abstract = {Besides the newly developed positron emission tomography scanners (microPET) dedicated to the in vivo functional study of small animals, autoradiography remains the reference technique widely used for functional brain imaging and the gold standard for the validation of in vivo results. The analysis of autoradiographic data is classically achieved in two dimensions (2D) using a section-by-section approach, is often limited to few sections and the delineation of the regions of interest to be analysed is directly performed on autoradiographic sections. In addition, such approach of analysis does not accommodate the possible anatomical shifts linked to dissymmetry associated with the sectioning process. This classic analysis is time-consuming, operator-dependent and can therefore lead to non-objective and non-reproducible results. In this paper, we have developed an automated and generic toolbox for processing of autoradiographic and corresponding histological rat brain sections based on a three-step approach, which involves: (1) an optimized digitization dealing with hundreds of autoradiographic and histological sections; (2) a robust reconstruction of the volumes based on a reliable registration method; and (3) an original 3D-geometry-based approach to analysis of anatomical and functional post-mortem data. The integration of the toolbox under a unified environment (in-house software BrainVISA, http://brainvisa.info) with a graphic interface enabled a robust and operator-independent exploitation of the overall anatomical and functional information. We illustrated the substantial qualitative and quantitative benefits obtained by applying our methodology to an activation study (rats, n=5, under unilateral visual stimulation).},

The sulcal pits, which are the putative first cortical folds, have for long been assumed to be under tight genetic control, but this was never quantified. We estimated the pit depth heritability in various brain regions using the high quality and large sample size of the Human Connectome Project pedigree cohort. Analysis of additive genetic variance indicated that their heritability ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 and displays a regional genetic control with an overall symmetric pattern between hemispheres. However, a noticeable asymmetry of heritability estimates is observed in the superior temporal sulcus and could thus be related to language lateralization. The heritability range estimated in this study reinforces the idea that cortical shape is determined primarily by nongenetic factors, which is consistent with the important increase of cortical folding from birth to adult life and thus predominantly constrained by environmental factors. Nevertheless, the genetic cues, implicated with various local levels of heritability in the formation of sulcal pits, play a fundamental role in the normal gyral pattern development. Quantifying their influence and identifying the underlying genetic variants would provide insight into neurodevelopmental disorders.},

This study presents a genome-wide haplotype analysis for 123 brain sulcus opening value (a measure of sulcal width) across the whole brain that include 16,304 subjects from UK Biobank. Using genetic maps, we defined 119,548 blocks of low recombination rate distributed along the 22 autosomal chromosomes and analyzed 1,051,316 haplotypes. To test associations between haplotypes and complex traits, we designed three statistical approaches. Two of them use a model that includes all the haplotypes for a single block, while the last approach considers each haplotype independently. All the statistics produced were assessed as rigorously as possible. Thanks to the rich imaging dataset at hand, we used resampling techniques to assess False Positive Rate for each statistical approach in a genome-wide and brain-wide context. The results on real data show that genome-wide haplotype analyses are more sensitive than single-SNP approach and account for local complex Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) structure, which makes genome-wide haplotype analysis an interesting and statistically sound alternative to the single-SNP counterpart.},

These statistical models can be designed in a multiblock framework to study the relationship between different multiomic data, and variable selection is often achieved by imposing constraints on the model parameters. A priori graph constraints have been used in the literature as a way to improve feature selection in the model, yielding more interpretability. However, it is still unclear how these graphs interact with the models and how they impact the feature selection. Additionally, with the availability of different graphs encoding different information, one can wonder how the choice of the graph meaningfully impacts the results obtained.We proposed to study the graph penalty impact on a multiblock model. Specifically, we used the SGCCA as the multiblock framework. We studied the effect of the penalty on the model using the TCGA-LGG dataset. Our findings are 3-fold. We showed that the graph penalty increases the number of selected genes from this dataset, while selecting genes already identified in other works as pertinent biomarkers in the pathology. We demonstrated that using different graphs leads to different though consistent results, but that graph density is the main factor influencing the obtained results. Finally, we showed that the graph penalty increases the performance of the survival prediction from the model-derived components and the interpretability of the results.Source code is freely available at https://github.com/neurospin/netSGCCA},

	abstract = {PurposePredicting H3.1, TP53, and ACVR1 mutations in DIPG could aid in the selection of therapeutic options. The contribution of clinical data and multi-modal MRI were studied for these three predictive tasks. To keep the maximum number of subjects, which is essential for a rare disease, missing data were considered. A multi-modal model was proposed, collecting all available data for each patient, without performing any imputation.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 80 patients with confirmed DIPG and at least one of the four MR modalities (T1w, T1c, T2w, and FLAIR), acquired with two different MR scanners was built. A pipeline including standardization of MR data and extraction of radiomic features within the tumor was applied. The values of radiomic features between the two MR scanners were realigned using the ComBat method. For each prediction task, the most robust features were selected based on a recursive feature elimination with cross-validation. Five different models, one based on clinical data and one per MR modality, were developed using logistic regression classifiers. The prediction of the multi-modal model was defined as the average of all possible prediction results among five for each patient. The performances of the models were compared using a leave-one-out approach.ResultsThe percentage of missing modalities ranged from 6 to 11\% across modalities and tasks. The performance of each individual model was dependent on each specific task, with an AUC of the ROC curve ranging from 0.63 to 0.80. The multi-modal model outperformed the clinical model for each prediction tasks, thus demonstrating the added value of MRI. Furthermore, regardless of performance criteria, the multi-modal model came in the first place or second place (very close to first). In the leave-one-out approach, the prediction of H3.1 (resp. ACVR1 and TP53) mutations achieved a balanced accuracy of 87.8\% (resp. 82.1 and 78.3\%).ConclusionCompared with a single modality approach, the multi-modal model combining multiple MRI modalities and clinical features was the most powerful to predict H3.1, ACVR1, and TP53 mutations and provided prediction, even in the case of missing modality. It could be proposed in the absence of a conclusive biopsy.},

	abstract = {Language is a unique trait of the human species, of which the genetic architecture remains largely unknown. Through language disorders studies, many candidate genes were identified. However, such complex and multifactorial trait is unlikely to be driven by only few genes and case-control studies, suffering from a lack of power, struggle to uncover significant variants. In parallel, neuroimaging has significantly contributed to the understanding of structural and functional aspects of language in the human brain and the recent availability of large scale cohorts like UK Biobank have made possible to study language via image-derived endophenotypes in the general population. Because of its strong relationship with task-based fMRI (tbfMRI) activations and its easiness of acquisition, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) have been more popularised, making it a good surrogate of functional neuronal processes. Taking advantage of such a synergistic system by aggregating effects across spatially distributed traits, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study (mvGWAS) between genetic variations and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of classical brain language areas in the inferior frontal (pars opercularis, triangularis and orbitalis), temporal and inferior parietal lobes (angular and supramarginal gyri), in 32,186 participants from UK Biobank. Twenty genomic loci were found associated with language FCs, out of which three were replicated in an independent replication sample. A locus in 3p11.1, regulating EPHA3 gene expression, is found associated with FCs of the semantic component of the language network, while a locus in 15q14, regulating THBS1 gene expression is found associated with FCs of the perceptual-motor language processing, bringing novel insights into the neurobiology of language.},

In this study, we assessed the contributions of genomic annotations spanning 30 million years to human sulcal morphology measured via MRI in more than 18,000 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that variation within brain-expressed human gained enhancers, regulatory genetic elements that emerged since our last common ancestor with Old World monkeys, explained more trait heritability than expected for the left and right calloso-marginal posterior fissures and the right central sulcus.

	abstract = {Tumour lesion segmentation is a key step to study and characterise cancer from MR neuroradiological images. Presently, numerous deep learning segmentation architectures have been shown to perform well on the specific tumour type they are trained on (e.g., glioblastoma in brain hemispheres). However, a high performing network heavily trained on a given tumour type may perform poorly on a rare tumour type for which no labelled cases allows training or transfer learning. Yet, because some visual similarities exist nevertheless between common and rare tumours, in the lesion and around it, one may split the problem into two steps: object detection and segmentation. For each step, trained networks on common lesions could be used on rare ones following a domain adaptation scheme without extra fine-tuning. This work proposes a resilient tumour lesion delineation strategy, based on the combination of established elementary networks that achieve detection and segmentation. Our strategy allowed us to achieve robust segmentation inference on a rare tumour located in an unseen tumour context region during training. As an example of a rare tumour, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), we achieve an average dice score of 0.62 without further training or network architecture adaptation.},

We performed a radiological and radiomic case control study, using an exploratory and a validation cohort.We screened 1162 diffuse gliomas (951 unselected cases and 211 preselected for FGFR3 protein immunopositivity), identifying 80 F3T3 positive gliomas. F3T3 was mutually exclusive with IDH mutation (P \&lt; 0.001) and EGFR amplification (P = 0.01), defining a distinct molecular cluster associated with CDK4 (P = 0.04) and MDM2 amplification (P = 0.03). F3T3 fusion was associated with longer survival for the whole series and for glioblastomas (median overall survival was 31.1 vs 19.9 mo, P = 0.02) and was an independent predictor of better outcome on multivariate analysis.F3T3 positive gliomas had specific MRI features, affecting preferentially insula and temporal lobe, and with poorly defined tumor margins.

The superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP), which is not observed in chimpanzees, represents an ideal phenotype to investigate the genetic variations that support human communication. The left STAP depth was significantly associated with a predicted enhancer annotation located in the 14q23.1 locus, between DACT1 and KIAA0586, in the UK Biobank British discovery sample (N = 16 515). This association was replicated in the IMAGEN cohort (N = 1726) and the UK Biobank non-British validation sample (N = 2161). This genomic region was also associated to a lesser extent with the right STAP depth and the formation of sulcal interruptions, “plis de passage,” in the bilateral STAP but not with other structural brain MRI phenotypes, highlighting its notable association with the superior temporal regions. Diffusion MRI emphasized an association with the fractional anisotropy of the left auditory fibers of the corpus callosum and with networks involved in linguistic processing in resting-state functional MRI. Overall, this evidence demonstrates a specific relationship between this locus and the establishment of the superior temporal regions that support human communication.},

Isolating homogenized subtypes could provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms and an overall better understanding of ASD. A total of 1093 participants from the population-based “Healthy Brain Network” cohort (Child Mind Institute in the New York City area, USA) were selected based on score availability in behaviors relevant to ASD, aged 6–18 and IQ {\textgreater}= 70. All participants underwent an unsupervised clustering analysis on behavioral dimensions to reveal subgroups with ASD traits, identified by the presence of social deficits. Analysis revealed three socially impaired ASD traits subgroups: (1) high in emotionally dysfunctional traits, (2) high in ADHD-like traits, and (3) high in anxiety and depressive symptoms. 527 subjects had good quality structural MRI T1 data. Site effects on cortical features were adjusted using the ComBat method. Neuroimaging analyses compared cortical thickness, gyrification, and surface area, and were controlled for age, gender, and IQ, and corrected for multiple comparisons. Structural neuroimaging analyses contrasting one combined heterogeneous ASD traits group against controls did not yield any significant differences. Unique cortical signatures, however, were observed within each of the three individual ASD traits subgroups versus controls. These observations provide evidence of ASD traits subtypes, and confirm the necessity of applying dimensional approaches to extract meaningful differences, thus reducing heterogeneity and paving the way to better understanding ASD traits.},

Using individual's PRS and MRI images in an aging general population like UK Biobank, we could point at imaging markers (endophenotypes) associated with early stages of AD. Method 16,549 subjects aged 47-74 from UK Biobank were included in the analysis. Using anatomical T1 MRI images (3T), opening measurements in 123 sulci were extracted with BrainVisa/Morphologist pipeline. Individual's PRS were computed using PRSice and summary statistics from IGAP study and then have been tested for an association with sulcal opening measurements. Result We obtained 24 sulci for which opening measurements was either positively or negatively associated with PRS (p {\textless} 0.05 after FDR correction). 17 sulcal opening showed increased widening w.r.t PRS with a main focus around the precuneus region, with superior parietal and central sulci. 7 sulcal opening showed opposite effect w.r.t the PRS and are located mostly in the orbital and insula region. See Figure for details. Conclusion For neurological disease like AD that have a strong genetic background, the combination of genetics and imaging data in large, aging general population studies like UK Biobank, provides powerful tools to identify new possible early markers of neurodegeneration. Focus on early risk patterns as the ones presented here with a main result on parietal sulcal alterations might facilitate identification of individuals at risk for cognitive decline and possibly support diagnostic procedures for AD.},

	url = {https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02289470},
	abstract = {Background: Language is a singularity of the human species. It is expected to have a genetic constituent. Estimation of the part of variance attributable to genetic variation across subjects in functional brain imaging within the regions of the language, provide us a quantification of the genetic influence. This part of variance -which corresponds to heritability- is important to prioritize the structural and functional brain features. Language specific tasks fMRI are generally used to achieve this decomposition of variance, but resting state fMRI remains also a valid alternative. Indeed, a growing evidence suggest that resting state functional connectivity pattern could be identified during cognitive task activation. UK Biobank with 19,336 subjects that underwent a rsfMRI, as well as Human Connectome Project (HCP) with 1113 subjects are a unique opportunity to study such a question. Methods: The present work consists in estimating the heritability of the language network, using region of interest, identified by (Pallier, 2011) during a task fMRI experience, based on resting state fMRI connectivity analysis. Imaging genetics data for both cohorts underwent a stringent quality control protocol, yielding 18,851 and 739 samples for UKB and HCP respectively. Results: Significant heritability, estimated via GCTA for UKB and SOLAR for HCP, were observed (UKB: h²=10\%-14\%, HCP: h²=22\%-43\%). Multiple test were corrected with Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: The obtained results suggest some genetic influence on the phenotype chosen which indicates that the human language brain organization is under relatively strong genetic control, strong enough to consider association studies with genotyping data.},

	abstract = {Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PCNSL is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with over 95\% of tumors belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group. We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on immunocompetent patients to address the possibility that common genetic variants influence the risk of developing PCNSL.We performed a meta-analysis of 2 new GWASs of PCNSL totaling 475 cases and 1134 controls of European ancestry. To increase genomic resolution, we imputed \&gt;10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms using the 1000 Genomes Project combined with UK10K as reference. In addition we performed a transcription factor binding disruption analysis and investigated the patterns of local chromatin by Capture Hi-C data.We identified independent risk loci at 3p22.1 (rs41289586, ANO10, P = 2.17 × 10−8) and 6p25.3 near EXOC2 (rs116446171, P = 1.95 x 10−13). In contrast, the lack of an association between rs41289586 and DLBCL suggests distinct germline predisposition to PCNSL and DLBCL. We found looping chromatin interactions between noncoding regions at 6p25.3 (rs11646171) with the IRF4 promoter and at 8q24.21 (rs13254990) with the MYC promoter, both genes with strong relevance to B-cell tumorigenesis.To our knowledge this is the first study providing insight into the genetic predisposition to PCNSL. Our findings represent an important step in defining the contribution of common genetic variation to the risk of developing PCNSL.},

The present study aimed at investigating if radiomic features measured at diagnosis time from structural MRI can predict histone H3 mutations and overall survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. To this end, 316 radiomic features from multimodal diagnostic MRI of 38 patients were extracted, and three clinical parameters were added. Two approaches for computing radiomic features were proposed: a global estimation from a spherical region of interest defined inside the tumor and a local estimation where features are computed inside the previously defined region from fixed size spherical patches and the mean of these features is considered. A feature selection pipeline was then developed. Three machine learning models for H3 mutation classification and three regression models for overall survival prediction were used. Leave-one-out F1-weighted scores for SVM model combining imaging and clinical features reached 0.83, showing a good prediction of H3 mutation using structural MRI. Results on overall survival prediction are not conclusive and suggest the need of a larger number of patients.},

This cortical shrinkage is visible on magnetic resonance images and is conveniently identified by the increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid in the sulci between two gyri. Here, we replicated this finding using the UK Biobank dataset and studied the genetic influence on these cortical features of aging. We divided all individuals genetically confirmed of British ancestry into two sub-cohorts (12,162 and 3435 subjects for discovery and replication samples, respectively). We found that the heritability of the sulcal opening ranges from 15 to 45\% (SE = 4.8\%). We identified 4 new loci that contribute to this opening, including one that also affects the sulci grey matter thickness. We identified the most significant variant (rs864736) on this locus as being an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the KCNK2 gene. This gene regulates the immune-cell into the central nervous system (CNS) and controls the CNS inflammation, which is implicated in cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic contribution to cortical shrinking and promote further investigation into these variants and genes in pathological context such as Alzheimer’s disease in which brain shrinkage is a key biomarker.},

	abstract = {Background
Lung cancer, and more precisely, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality due to its high prevalence. Likewise, brain metastases from lung cancer are the most frequent type of secondary brain tumors. Different prognostic scores have been proposed to better stratify the treatment of brain metastases. More recently, lung GPA has been updated considering two frequent molecular characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma: EGFR and ALK alterations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the crosstalk between imaging features and the currently used prognostic scores is unknown.We sought to analyze the clinical value of radiomics data in the prediction of survival in patients with brain mets from NSCLC.

Material and Methods
We have selected 29 patients with brain metastases of NSCLC treated during 2015–2016 at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. We selected patients with neither previous history of brain mets nor brain surgery and high-quality structural MRI.We extracted 1428 radiomic features per patient, including: first-order statistics, volume, shape, texture and wavelet analysis using pyradiomics on Gadolinium enhanced T1 and FLAIR RM images. Using the plsRcox package, several Cox models were constructed with either clinical (GPA score, EGFR mutation and ALK fusion status) or radiomics features or both. The goodness of fit was assessed with the Harrell’s concordance index using 5 fold cross-validation.

Results
The performance of the radiomics model (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.88, SD 0.08) to predict OS was the best compared to the prediction using clinical data (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.77, SD 0.25). Surprisingly, the addition of clinical data to the radiomics model decreased the performance of OS prediction (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.83, SD 0.17).

Conclusion
Radiomics analysis of brain mets from NSCLC may provide additional clinically relevant data on the survival, in a non-invasive way. The results of this small cohort are currently being validated in a larger dataset of patients.},
