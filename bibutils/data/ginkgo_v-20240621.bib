	abstract = {We present a Bayesian framework for atlas construction of multi-object shape complexes comprised of both surface and curve meshes. It is general and can be applied to any parametric deformation framework and to all shape models with which it is possible to define probability density functions (PDF). Here, both curve and surface meshes are modelled as Gaussian random varifolds, using a finite-dimensional approximation space on which PDFs can be defined. Using this framework, we can automatically estimate the parameters balancing data-terms and deformation regularity, which previously required user tuning. Moreover, it is also possible to estimate a well-conditioned covariance matrix of the deformation parameters. We also extend the proposed framework to data-sets with multiple group labels. Groups share the same template and their deformation parameters are modelled with different distributions. We can statistically compare the groups'distributions since they are defined on the same space. We test our algorithm on 20 Gilles de la Tourette patients and 20 control subjects, using three sub-cortical regions and their incident white matter fiber bundles. We compare their morphological characteristics and variations using a single diffeomorphism in the ambient space. The proposed method will be integrated with the Deformetrica software package, publicly available at www.deformetrica.org.},

	abstract = {The deformable atlas paradigm has been at the core of computational anatomy during the last two decades. Spatial normalization is the variant endowing the atlas with a coordinate system used for voxel-based aggregation of images across subjects and studies. This framework has largely contributed to the success of brain mapping. Brain spatial normalization, however, is still ill-posed because of the complexity of the human brain architecture and the lack of architectural landmarks in standard morphological MRI. Multi-atlas strategies have been developed during the last decade to overcome some difficulties in the context of segmentation. A new generation of registration algorithms embedding architectural features inferred for instance from diffusion or functional MRI is on the verge to improve the architectural value of spatial normalization. A better understanding of the architectural meaning of the cortical folding pattern will lead to use some sulci as complementary constraints. Improving the architectural compliance of spatial normalization may impose to relax the diffeomorphic constraint usually underlying atlas warping. A two-level strategy could be designed: in each region, a dictionary of templates of incompatible folding patterns would be collected and matched in a way or another using rare architectural information, while individual subjects would be aligned using diffeomorphisms to the closest template. Manifold learning could help to aggregate subjects according to their morphology. Connectivity-based strategies could emerge as an alternative to deformation-based alignment leading to match the connectomes of the subjects rather than images.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-functioning autism (HFA) and schizophrenia (SZ) are two of the main neurodevelopmental disorders, sharing several clinical dimensions and risk factors. Their exact relationship is poorly understood, and few studies have directly compared both disorders. Our aim was thus to directly compare neuroanatomy of HFA and SZ using a multimodal MRI design.
METHODS: We scanned 79 male adult subjects with 3T MRI (23 with HFA, 24 with SZ and 32 healthy controls, with similar non-verbal IQ). We compared them using both diffusion-based whole-brain tractography and T1 voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: HFA and SZ groups exhibited similar white matter alterations in the left fronto-occipital inferior fasciculus with a decrease in generalized fractional anisotropy compared with controls. In grey matter, the HFA group demonstrated bilateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate increases in contrast with prefrontal and left temporal reductions in SZ.
CONCLUSION: HFA and SZ may share common white matter deficits in long-range connections involved in social functions, but opposite grey matter abnormalities in frontal regions that subserve complex cognitive functions. Our results are consistent with the fronto-occipital underconnectivity theory of HFA and the altered connectivity hypothesis of SZ and suggest the existence of both associated and diametrical liabilities to these two conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal maturation of brain connectivity is supposed to underlie the dysfunctional emotion regulation in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). To test this hypothesis, white matter integrity is usually investigated using measures of water diffusivity provided by MRI. Here we consider a more intuitive aspect of the morphometry of the white matter tracts: the shape of the fibre bundles, which is associated with neurodevelopment. We analyzed the shape of 3 tracts involved in BD: the cingulum (CG), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and arcuate fasciculus (AF).
METHODS: We analyzed diffusion MRI data in patients with BD and healthy controls. The fibre bundles were reconstructed using Q-ball-based tractography and automated segmentation. Using Isomap, a manifold learning method, the differences in the shape of the reconstructed bundles were visualized and quantified.
RESULTS: We included 112 patients and 82 controls in our analysis. We found the left AF of patients to be further extended toward the temporal pole, forming a tighter hook than in controls. We found no significant difference in terms of shape for the left UF, the left CG or the 3 right fasciculi. However, in patients compared with controls, the ventrolateral branch of the left UF in the orbitofrontal region had a tendency to be larger, and the left CG of patients had a tendency to be smaller in the frontal lobe and larger in the parietal lobe.
LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the left AF in patients with BD. The statistical tendencies observed for the left UF and left CG deserve further study.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Motion-robust multi-slab imaging of hippocampal inner structure in vivo at 7T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Motion is a crucial issue for ultra-high resolution imaging, such as can be achieved with 7T MRI. An acquisition protocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7T. It relies on a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion. In order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full slab covering the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition time. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired slabs within a final 3D-consistent high-resolution slab covering the whole hippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three groups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on three issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion artifacts and registration procedure performance.
RESULTS: Overall, T2-weighted acquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration yielded high quality datasets in 96 \% of the subjects, thus compatible with further analyses of hippocampal inner structure.
CONCLUSION: Multi-slab acquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time and consequently motion artifacts for ultra-high resolution imaging of the inner structure of the hippocampus.},

Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of pathogenesis triggered by abnormal connectivity. In this work we automatically created a multi-subject atlas of SWM diffusion-based bundles of the whole brain. For each subject, the complete cortico-cortical tractogram is first split into sub-tractograms connecting pairs of gyri. Then intra-subject shape-based fiber clustering performs compression of each sub-tractogram into a set of bundles. Proceeding further with shape-based clustering provides a match of the bundles across subjects. Bundles found in most of the subjects are instantiated in the atlas. To increase robustness, this procedure was performed with two independent groups of subjects, in order to discard bundles without match across the two independent atlases. Finally, the resulting intersection atlas was projected on a third independent group of subjects in order to filter out bundles without reproducible and reliable projection. The final multi-subject diffusion-based U-fiber atlas is composed of 100 bundles in total, 50 per hemisphere, from which 35 are common to both hemispheres.},

	abstract = {Mirror movements are involuntary symmetrical movements of one side of the body that mirror voluntary movements of the other side. Congenital mirror movement disorder is a rare condition characterized by mirror movements that persist throughout adulthood in subjects with no other clinical abnormalities. The affected individuals have mirror movements predominating in the muscles that control the fingers and are unable to perform purely unimanual movements. Congenital mirror movement disorder thus provides a unique paradigm for studying the lateralization of motor control. We conducted a multimodal, controlled study of patients with congenital mirror movements associated with RAD51 haploinsufficiency (n = 7, mean age 33.3 ± 16.8 years) by comparison with age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (n = 14, mean age 33.9 ± 16.1 years). We showed that patients with congenital mirror movements induced by RAD51 deficiency had: (i) an abnormal decussation of the corticospinal tract; (ii) abnormal interhemispheric inhibition and bilateral cortical activation of primary motor areas during intended unimanual movements; and (iii) an abnormal involvement of the supplementary motor area during both unimanual and bimanual movements. The lateralization of motor control thus requires a fine interplay between interhemispheric communication and corticospinal wiring. This fine interplay determines: (i) the delivery of appropriate motor plans from the supplementary motor area to the primary motor cortex; (ii) the lateralized activation of the primary motor cortex; and (iii) the unilateral transmission of the motor command to the limb involved in the intended movement. Our results also unveil an unexpected function of RAD51 in corticospinal development of the motor system.},

METHODS: We examined (1) Parkinson's disease patients with impaired postural control and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (further abbreviated as sleep disorder), (2) Parkinson's disease patients with sleep disorder only, (3) Parkinson's disease patients with neither impaired postural control nor sleep disorder, and (4) healthy volunteers. We assessed postural control with clinical scores and biomechanical recordings during gait initiation. Participants had video polysomnography, daytime sleepiness self-evaluation, and resting-state functional MRIs.
RESULTS: Patients with impaired postural control and sleep disorder had longer duration of anticipatory postural adjustments during gait initiation and decreased functional connectivity between the pedunculopontine nucleus and the supplementary motor area in the locomotor network that correlated negatively with the duration of anticipatory postural adjustments. Both groups of patients with sleep disorder had decreased functional connectivity between the pedunculopontine nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the arousal network that correlated with daytime sleepiness. The degree of dysfunction in the arousal network was related to the degree of connectivity in the locomotor network in all patients with sleep disorder, but not in patients without sleep disorder or healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSIONS: These results shed light on the functional neuroanatomy of pedunculopontine nucleus networks supporting the clinical manifestation and the interdependence between sleep and postural control impairments in Parkinson's disease. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

	abstract = {Fiber bundles stemming from tractography algorithms contain many streamlines. They require therefore a great amount of computer memory and computational resources to be stored, visualised and processed. We propose an approximation scheme for fiber bundles which results in a parsimonious representation of weighted prototypes. Prototypes are chosen among the streamlines and they represent groups of similar streamlines. Their weight is related to the number of approximated streamlines. Both streamlines and prototypes are modelled as weighted currents. This computational model does not need point-to-point correspondences and two streamlines are considered similar if their endpoints are close to each other and if their pathways follow similar trajectories. Moreover, the space of weighted currents is a vector space with a closed-form metric. This permits easy computation of the approximation error and the selection of the prototypes is based on the minimisation of this error. We propose an iterative algorithm which approximates independently and simultaneously all the fascicles of the bundle in a fast and accurate way. We show that the resulting representation preserves the shape of the bundle and it can be used to accurately reconstruct the original structural connectivity. We evaluate our algorithm on bundles obtained from both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms. The resulting approximations use on average only 2\% of the original streamlines as prototypes. This drastically reduces the computational burden of the processes where the geometry of the streamlines is considered. We demonstrate its effectiveness using as example the registration between two fiber bundles.},

In this study, we aimed to identify and describe its consequences beyond the lack of callosal fibres, on the morphology, microstructure and asymmetries of the main white matter bundles with diffusion imaging and fibre tractography. Seven children aged between 9 and 13 years old and seven age- and gender-matched control children were studied. First, we focused on bundles within the mesial region of the cerebral hemispheres: the corpus callosum, Probst bundles and cingulum which were selected using a conventional region-based approach. We demonstrated that the Probst bundles have a wider connectivity than the previously described rostrocaudal direction, and a microstructure rather distinct from the cingulum but relatively close to callosal remnant fibres. A sigmoid bundle was found in two partial ageneses. Second, the corticospinal tract, thalamic radiations and association bundles were extracted automatically via an atlas of adult white matter bundles to overcome bias resulting from a priori knowledge of the bundles' anatomical morphology and trajectory. Despite the lack of callosal fibres and the colpocephaly observed in CCD, all major white matter bundles were identified with a relatively normal morphology, and preserved microstructure (i.e. fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity) and asymmetries. Consequently the bundles' organisation seems well conserved in brains with CCD. These results await further investigations with functional imaging before apprehending the cognition variability in children with isolated dysgenesis.},

	abstract = {Identifying potentially unique features of the human cerebral cortex is a first step to understanding how evolution has shaped the brain in our species. By analyzing MR images obtained from 177 humans and 73 chimpanzees, we observed a human-specific asymmetry in the superior temporal sulcus at the heart of the communication regions and which we have named the "superior temporal asymmetrical pit" (STAP). This 45-mm-long segment ventral to Heschl's gyrus is deeper in the right hemisphere than in the left in 95\% of typical human subjects, from infanthood till adulthood, and is present, irrespective of handedness, language lateralization, and sex although it is greater in males than in females. The STAP also is seen in several groups of atypical subjects including persons with situs inversus, autistic spectrum disorder, Turner syndrome, and corpus callosum agenesis. It is explained in part by the larger number of sulcal interruptions in the left than in the right hemisphere. Its early presence in the infants of this study as well as in fetuses and premature infants suggests a strong genetic influence. Because this asymmetry is barely visible in chimpanzees, we recommend the STAP region during midgestation as an important phenotype to investigate asymmetrical variations of gene expression among the primate lineage. This genetic target may provide important insights regarding the evolution of the crucial cognitive abilities sustained by this sulcus in our species, namely communication and social cognition.},

	abstract = {In vivo evaluation of the brain white matter maturation is still a challenging task with no existing gold standards. In this article we propose an original approach to evaluate the early maturation of the white matter bundles, which is based on comparison of infant and adult groups using the Mahalanobis distance computed from four complementary MRI parameters: quantitative qT1 and qT2 relaxation times, longitudinal λ║ and transverse λ⊥ diffusivities from diffusion tensor imaging. Such multi-parametric approach is expected to better describe maturational asynchrony than conventional univariate approaches because it takes into account complementary dependencies of the parameters on different maturational processes, notably the decrease in water content and the myelination. Our approach was tested on 17 healthy infants (aged 3- to 21-week old) for 18 different bundles. It finely confirmed maturational asynchrony across the bundles: the spino-thalamic tract, the optic radiations, the cortico-spinal tract and the fornix have the most advanced maturation, while the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculi, the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the external capsule have the most delayed maturation. Furthermore, this approach was more reliable than univariate approaches as it revealed more maturational relationships between the bundles and did not violate a priori assumptions on the temporal order of the bundle maturation. Mahalanobis distances decreased exponentially with age in all bundles, with the only difference between them explained by different onsets of maturation. Estimation of these relative delays confirmed that the most dramatic changes occur during the first post-natal year.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize medulla oblongata damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in Parkinson disease (PD) and correlate it with dysfunction of the cardiac sympathetic/vagal balance.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients with PD and 24 healthy controls were included in the study. All participants underwent clinical examination and 3T MRI using 3D T1-weighted imaging and DTI. DTI metrics were calculated within manually drawn regions of interest. Heart rate variability was evaluated using spectral analysis of the R-R cardiac interval during REM and slow-wave sleep based on continuous overnight electrocardiographic monitoring. Respiratory frequency was measured in 30-second contiguous epochs of REM and slow-wave sleep. The relationships between imaging and cardiac variables were calculated using partial correlations followed by the multiple comparisons permutation approach.
RESULTS: The changes in heart rate and respiratory frequency variability from slow-wave sleep to REM sleep in healthy controls were no longer detectable in patients with PD. There were significant increases in the mean (p = 0.006), axial (p = 0.006), and radial diffusivities (p = 0.005) in the medulla oblongata of patients with PD. In PD, diffusion changes were specifically correlated with a lower heart rate and respiratory frequency variability during REM sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that medulla oblongata damage underlies cardiac sympathetic/vagal balance and respiratory dysfunction in patients with PD.},

We investigated cortico-striatal connectivity modifications occurring in HD patients using a novel approach which focuses on the projection of the connectivity profile of the basal ganglia onto the cortex. This approach consists in computing, for each subcortical structure, surface connectivity measures representing its strength of connections to the cortex and comparing these measures across groups. In this study, we focused on Huntington disease as an application of this new approach. First, surface cortico-striatal connectivity measures of a group of healthy subjects were averaged in order to infer the "normal" connectivity profile of the striatum to the cortex. Second, a statistical analysis was performed from the surface connectivity measures of healthy subjects and HD patients in order to detect the cortical gyri presenting altered cortico-striatal connectivity in HD. Lastly, percentage differences of connectivity between healthy subjects and patients were inferred, for each nucleus of the striatum, from the connectivity measures of the cortical gyri presenting a significant connectivity difference between the two groups. These percentage differences characterize the axonal disruptions between the striatum and the cortex occurring in HD. We found selective region-specific degeneration of cortical connections predominating for associative and primary sensorimotor connections and with relative preservation of limbic connections. Our method can be used to infer novel connectivity-based markers of HD pathological process.},

The resulting white matter, together with the gray matter, are then deformed by the second diffeomorphism. The two diffeomorphisms are related and jointly optimised. In this way, the, first diffeomorphisms explain the variability in structural connectivity within the population, namely both changes in the connected areas of the gray matter and in the geometry of the pathway of the tracts. The second diffeomorphisms put into correspondence the homologous anatomical structures across subjects. Fiber bundles are approximated with weighted prototypes using the metric of weighted currents. The atlas, the covariance matrix of deformation parameters and the noise variance of each structure are automatically estimated using a Bayesian approach.

Compared to healthy controls, patients with single-domain aMCI were impaired in learning from positive feedback, while learning from negative outcomes was preserved. Among pathways within the brain circuit involved in feedback learning, abnormal white matter microstructure was observed in tracts, which connect left-hemispheric amygdala with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In all participants, reduced white matter integrity in this left fiber tract was specifically associated with learning from positive outcomes. Microstructure of right-hemispheric tracts between amygdala and entorhinal cortex was related to learning from negative feedback, and was not compromised in aMCI patients. Our results provide new insight into how anatomical connections might contribute to impaired and preserved aspects of learning behaviors in the early AD process and indicate potential compensatory mechanisms.},

The present work contributes a multivariate statistical learning approach that can extract the major brain networks and quantify their configuration during various psychological tasks. The method is validated in two extensive datasets (n = 500 and n = 81) by model-based generation of synthetic activity maps from recombination of shared network topographies. To study a use case, we formally revisited the poorly understood difference between neural activity underlying idling versus goal-directed behavior. We demonstrate that task-specific neural activity patterns can be explained by plausible combinations of resting-state networks. The possibility of decomposing a mental task into the relative contributions of major brain networks, the "network co-occurrence architecture" of a given task, opens an alternative access to the neural substrates of human cognition.},

We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas, and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time, the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages, while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric, thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result, a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover, parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds, respectively. This performance enables the use of the algorithm in truly interactive applications for visualization, analysis, and segmentation of large white matter tractography datasets.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated how frontal white matter (WM) alterations in patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) are linked to motivational dysregulation, often reported in the form of risk-taking and impulsivity, and whether structure-function relations in patients might differ from healthy subjects (HC).
METHOD: We acquired diffusion data from 24 euthymic BD-I patients and 24 controls, to evaluate WM integrity of selected frontal tracts. Risk-taking was assessed by the Cambridge Gambling Task and impulsivity by self-report with the Barratt-Impulsiveness Scale.
RESULTS: BD-I patients displayed significantly lower integrity in the right cingulum compared to HC. They also showed more risk-taking behavior and reported increased trait-impulsivity. Risk-taking was negatively associated with WM integrity in the right cingulum. Impulsivity was not related to WM integrity in investigated tracts. Together with age and sex, FA in the cingulum explained 25\% of variance in risk-taking scores in all study participants. The left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was specifically predictive of risk-taking behavior in BD-I patients, but not in HC.
LIMITATIONS: The employed parameters did not allow us to specify the exact origin of WM changes, nor did the method allow the analysis of specific brain subregions. Also, sample size was moderate and the sample included patients with lifetime alcohol dependence/abuse, hence effects found need replication and have to be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSION: Our results further strengthen recent models linking structural changes in frontal networks to behavioral markers of BD-I. They extend recent findings by showing that risk-taking is also linked to the cingulum in BD-I and HC, while other prefrontal tracts (IFOF) are specifically implicated in risk-taking behavior in BD-I patients. Meanwhile, self-reported impulsivity was not associated with WM integrity of the tracts investigated in our study.},

Moreover, alterations of different hippocampal layers may reflect distinct pathological processes. 7 T MRI dramatically improves the visualization of hippocampal subregions and layers. In this study, we aimed to assess whether 7 T MRI can detect volumetric changes in hippocampal layers in vivo in patients with AD. We studied four AD patients and seven control subjects. MR images were acquired using a whole-body 7 T scanner with an eight channel transmit-receive coil. Hippocampal subregions were manually segmented from coronal T2*-weighted gradient echo images with 0.3 × 0.3 × 1.2 mm3 resolution using a protocol that distinguishes between layers richer or poorer in neuronal bodies. Five subregions were segmented in the region of the hippocampal body: alveus, strata radiatum, lacunosum and moleculare (SRLM) of the cornu Ammonis (CA), hilum, stratum pyramidale of CA and stratum pyramidale of the subiculum. We found strong bilateral reductions in the SRLM of the cornu Ammonis and in the stratum pyramidale of the subiculum (p {\textless} 0.05), with average cross-sectional area reductions ranging from -29\% to -49\%. These results show that it is possible to detect volume loss in distinct hippocampal layers using segmentation of 7 T MRI. 7 T MRI-based segmentation is a promising tool for AD research.},

	abstract = {Background Previous studies have reported MRI abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), although only a few studies have directly compared callosal areas in psychotic versus nonpsychotic patients with this disorder. We sought to compare regional callosal areas in a large international multicentre sample of patients with BD and healthy controls. Methods We analyzed anatomic T-1 MRI data of patients with BD-I and healthy controls recruited from 4 sites (France, Germany, Ireland and the United States). We obtained the mid-sagittal areas of 7 CC subregions using an automatic CC delineation. Differences in regional callosal areas between patients and controls were compared using linear mixed models (adjusting for age, sex, handedness, brain volume, history of alcohol abuse/dependence, lithium or antipsychotic medication status, symptomatic status and site) and multiple comparisons correction. We also compared regional areas of the CC between patients with BD with and without a history of psychotic features. Results We included 172 patients and 146 controls in our study. Patients with BD had smaller adjusted mid-sagittal CC areas than controls along the posterior body, the isthmus and the splenium of the CC. Patients with a positive history of psychotic features had greater adjusted area of the rostral CC region than those without a history of psychotic features. Limitations We found small to medium effect sizes, and there was no calibration technique among the sites. Conclusion Our results suggest that BD with psychosis is associated with a different pattern of interhemispheric connectivity than BD without psychosis and could be considered a relevant neuroimaging subtype of BD.},

	abstract = {Dissecting neural circuitry in non-human primates (NHP) is crucial to identify potential neuromodulation anatomical targets for the treatment of pharmacoresistant neuropsychiatric diseases by electrical neuromodulation. How targets of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cortical targets of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) compare and might complement one another is an important question. Combining optogenetics and tractography may enable anatomo-functional characterization of large brain cortico-subcortical neural pathways. For the proof-of-concept this approach was used in the NHP brain to characterize the motor cortico-subthalamic pathway (m\_CSP) which might be involved in DBS action mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Rabies-G-pseudotyped and Rabies-G-VSVg-pseudotyped EIAV lentiviral vectors encoding the opsin ChR2 gene were stereotaxically injected into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and were retrogradely transported to the layer of the motor cortex projecting to STN. A precise anatomical mapping of this pathway was then performed using histology-guided high angular resolution MRI tractography guiding accurately cortical photostimulation of m\_CSP origins. Photoexcitation of m\_CSP axon terminals or m\_CSP cortical origins modified the spikes distribution for photosensitive STN neurons firing rate in non-equivalent ways. Optogenetic tractography might help design preclinical neuromodulation studies in NHP models of neuropsychiatric disease choosing the most appropriate target for the tested hypothesis.},

However, DW images are noisy at high b-values and acquisitions are slow when using a large number of measurements, such as in Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI). This work aims to denoise DWI and reduce the number of required measurements, while maintaining data quality. To capture the structure of DWI data, we use sparse dictionary learning constrained by the physical properties of the signal: symmetry and positivity. The method learns a dictionary of diffusion profiles on all the DW images at the same time and then scales to full brain data. Its performance is investigated with simulations and two real DSI datasets. We obtain better signal estimates from noisy measurements than by applying mirror symmetry through the q-space origin, Gaussian denoising or state-of-the-art non-local means denoising. Using a high-resolution dictionary learnt on another subject, we show that we can reduce the number of images acquired while still generating high resolution DSI data. Using dictionary learning, one can denoise DW images effectively and perform faster acquisitions. Higher b-value acquisitions and DSI techniques are possible with approximately 40 measurements. This opens important perspectives for the connectomics community using DSI.},

However, it remains unknown to what extent these findings are related to each other and whether these abnormalities represent risk factors or consequences of the illness.
METHODS: We addressed the first question by comparing 19 patients with BD1 and 19 healthy control subjects (sample 1) with diffusion tensor imaging, the Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift Task, and the Cambridge Gambling Task. The second question we approached by applying the same protocol to 22 healthy first-degree relatives of patients with BD1 and 22 persons without a family history of mental disorders (sample 2).
RESULTS: In comparison with their control groups, BD1 patients and healthy first-degree relatives of patients with BD1 showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule and right uncinate fasciculus. White matter integrity in corpus callosum was reduced in BD1 patients only. In addition, reduced FA in anterior limb of the internal capsule correlated significantly with an increased number of errors during set shifting and increased risk taking and reduced FA in uncinate fasciculus correlated significantly with increased risk taking.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar white matter alterations in BD1 patients and healthy relatives of BD1 patients are associated with comparable behavioral abnormalities. Further, results indicate that altered frontolimbic and frontothalamic connectivity and corresponding behavioral abnormalities might be a trait and vulnerability marker of BD1, whereas interhemispheric connectivity appears to be a disease marker.},

	abstract = {In Parkinson's disease, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an early non-dopaminergic syndrome with nocturnal violence and increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep that can precede Parkinsonism by several years. The neuronal origin of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson's disease is not precisely known; however, the locus subcoeruleus in the brainstem has been implicated as this structure blocks muscle tone during normal rapid eye movement sleep in animal models and can be damaged in Parkinson's disease. Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex in patients with Parkinson's disease using combined neuromelanin-sensitive, structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging approaches. We compared 24 patients with Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 12 patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent clinical examination and characterization of rapid eye movement sleep using video-polysomnography and multimodal imaging at 3 T. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was evident in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area in patients with Parkinson's disease that was more marked in patients with than those without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Reduced signal intensity correlated with the percentage of abnormally increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep. The results confirmed that this complex is affected in Parkinson's disease and showed a gradual relationship between damage to this structure, presumably the locus subcoeruleus, and abnormal muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, which is the cardinal marker of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. In longitudinal studies, the technique may also provide early markers of non-dopaminergic Parkinson's disease pathology to predict the occurrence of Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the herpesviridae family that has a limbic and temporal gray matter tropism. It is usually latent in humans but has been associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and cognitive deficits in some populations. Hippocampal decreased volume and dysfunction play a critical role in these cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that CMV seropositivity and serointensity would be associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
METHODS: 102 healthy controls, 118 patients with bipolar disorder and 69 patients with schizophrenia performed the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and had blood samples drawn to assess CMV IgG levels. A subgroup of 52 healthy controls, 31 patients with bipolar disorder and 27 patients with schizophrenia underwent T1 MRI for hippocampal volumetry. We analyzed the association between CMV serointensity and seropositivity with hippocampal volume. We also explored the correlation between CMV serointensity and seropositivity and CVLT scores.
RESULTS: In both patient groups but not in controls, higher CMV serointensity was significantly associated with smaller right hippocampal volume. Further, in the group of patients with schizophrenia but not bipolar disorder, CMV serointensity was negatively correlated with CVLT scores.
CONCLUSION: CMV IgG titers are associated with decreased hippocampal volume and poorer episodic verbal memory in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The mechanism of this association warrants further exploration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diffusion imaging techniques such as DTI and HARDI are difficult to implement in infants because of their sensitivity to subject motion. A short acquisition time is generally preferred, at the expense of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Before estimating the local diffusion model, most pre-processing techniques only register diffusion-weighted volumes, without correcting for intra-slice artifacts due to motion or technical problems. Here, we propose a fully automated strategy, which takes advantage of a high orientation number and is based on spherical-harmonics decomposition of the diffusion signal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The correction strategy is based on two successive steps: 1) automated detection and resampling of corrupted slices; 2) correction for eddy current distortions and realignment of misregistered volumes. It was tested on DTI data from adults and non-sedated healthy infants.
RESULTS: The methodology was validated through simulated motions applied to an uncorrupted dataset and through comparisons with an unmoved reference. Second, we showed that the correction applied to an infant group enabled to improve DTI maps and to increase the reliability of DTI quantification in the immature cortico-spinal tract.
CONCLUSION: This automated strategy performed reliably on DTI datasets and can be applied to spherical single- and multiple-shell diffusion imaging.},

Brain development relies on complex and intermingled mechanisms especially during gestation and first post-natal months, with intense interactions between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Although the baby's brain is organized early on, it is not a miniature adult brain: regional brain changes are asynchronous and protracted, i.e. sensory-motor regions develop early and quickly, whereas associative regions develop later and slowly over decades. Concurrently, the infant/child gradually achieves new performances, but how brain maturation relates to changes in behavior is poorly understood, requiring non-invasive in vivo imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two main processes of early white matter development are reviewed: (1) establishment of connections between brain regions within functional networks, leading to adult-like organization during the last trimester of gestation, (2) maturation (myelination) of these connections during infancy to provide efficient transfers of information. Current knowledge from post-mortem descriptions and in vivo MRI studies is summed up, focusing on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and quantitative mapping of T1/T2 relaxation times, myelin water fraction and magnetization transfer ratio.},

This approach aims to study brain morphometry as a whole and not as a set of different components, focusing mainly on the shape and relative position of different anatomical structures which is fundamental in neuro-anatomical studies. We propose a generic algorithm to estimate templates of sets of curves (fiber bundles) and closed surfaces (sub-cortical structures) which have the same "form" (topology) of the shapes present in the population. This atlas construction method is based on a Bayesian framework which brings to two main improvements with respect to previous shape based methods. First, it allows to estimate from the data set a parameter specific to each object which was previously fixed by the user: the trade-off between data-term and regularity of deformations. In a multi-object analysis these parameters balance the contributions of the different objects and the need for an automatic estimation is even more crucial. Second, the covariance matrix of the deformation parameters is estimated during the atlas construction in a way which is less sensitive to the outliers of the population.},

To this end, we propose an approximation scheme which gives as result a more concise but at the same time exhaustive representation of a fiber bundle. It is based on a novel computational model for fibers, called weighted currents, characterised by a metric that considers both the pathway and the anatomical locations of the endpoints of the fibers. Similarity has therefore a twofold connotation: geometrical and related to the connectivity. The core idea is to use this metric for approximating a fiber bundle with a set of weighted prototypes, chosen among the fibers, which represent ensembles of similar fibers. The weights are related to the fibers represented b y t he prototypes. The algorithm is divided into two steps. First, the main modes of the fiber bundle are detected using a modularity based clustering algorithm. Second, a prototype fiber selection process is carried on in each cluster separately. This permits to explain the main patterns of the fiber bundle in a fast and accurate way.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel analysis framework, where we estimate the amount of variance that is fit by a random effects subspace learned on other images; we show that a principal component regression estimator outperforms other regression models and that it fits a significant proportion (10\% to 25\%) of the between-subject variability.

	abstract = {A hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dopaminergic denervation is commonly imaged using radiotracer imaging in target structures such as the striatum. Until recently, imaging made only a modest contribution to detecting neurodegenerative changes in the substantia nigra (SN) directly. Histologically, the SN is subdivided into the ventral pars reticulata and the dorsal pars compacta, which is composed of dopaminergic neurons. In humans, dopaminergic neurons, which are known to accumulate neuromelanin, form clusters of cells (nigrosomes) that penetrate deep into the SN pars reticulata (SNr). The SNr contains higher levels of iron than the SNc in normal subjects. Neuromelanin and T2*-weighted imaging therefore better detect the SNc and the SNr, respectively. The development of ultra-high field 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the increase in spatial resolution and in contrast that was needed to detect changes in SN morphology. 7T MRI allows visualization of nigrosome-1 as a hyperintense signal area on T2*-weighted images in the SNc of healthy subjects and its absence in PD patients, probably because of the loss of melanized neurons and the increase of iron deposition. This review is designed to provide a better understanding of the correspondence between the outlines and subdivisions of the SN detected using different MRI contrasts and the histological organization of the SN. The recent findings obtained at 7T will then be presented in relation to histological knowledge.},

We describe a sequential version of the algorithm that runs on a desktop computer CPU, as well as a highly parallel version that uses a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) as an accelerator. Our sequential implementation runs 270 times faster than a C++/Python implementation of a previous algorithm based on the same segmentation method, and 21 times faster than a highly optimized C version of the same previous algorithm. Our parallelized implementation exploits the multiple computation units and memory hierarchy of the GPU to further speed up the algorithm by a factor of 30 with respect to our sequential code. As a result, the time to segment a subject dataset of 800,000 fibers is reduced from more than 2.5 hours in the Python/C++ code, to less than one second in the GPU version.},

	abstract = {Already during the last trimester of gestation, functional responses are recorded in foetuses and preterm newborns, attesting an already complex cerebral architecture. Then throughout childhood, anatomical connections are further refined but at different rates and over asynchronous periods across functional networks. Concurrently, infants gradually achieve new psychomotor and cognitive skills. Only the recent use of non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) has opened the possibility to understand the relationships between brain maturation and skills development in vivo. In this review, we describe how these techniques have been applied to study the white matter maturation. At the structural level, the early architecture and myelination of bundles have been assessed with diffusion and relaxometry MRI, recently integrated in multi-compartment models and multi-parametric approaches. Nevertheless, technical limitations prevent us to map major developmental mechanisms such as fibers growth and pruning, and the progressive maturation at the bundle scale in case of mixing trajectories. At the functional level, M/EEG have been used to record different visual, somatosensory and auditory evoked responses. Because the conduction velocity of neural impulses increases with the myelination of connections, major changes in the components latency are observed throughout development. But so far, only a few studies have related structural and functional markers of white matter myelination. Such multi-modal approaches will be a major challenge in future research, not only to understand normal development, but also to characterize early mechanisms of pathologies and the influence of fetal and perinatal interventions on later outcome.},

	abstract = {The synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP25 is a key player in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and has been associated with multiple psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We recently identified a promoter variant in SNAP25, rs6039769, that is associated with early-onset bipolar disorder and a higher gene expression level in human prefrontal cortex. In the current study, we showed that this variant was associated both in males and females with schizophrenia in two independent cohorts. We then combined in vitro and in vivo approaches in humans to understand the functional impact of the at-risk allele. Thus, we showed in vitro that the rs6039769 C allele was sufficient to increase the SNAP25 transcription level. In a postmortem expression analysis of 33 individuals affected with schizophrenia and 30 unaffected control subjects, we showed that the SNAP25b/SNAP25a ratio was increased in schizophrenic patients carrying the rs6039769 at-risk allele. Last, using genetics imaging in a cohort of 71 subjects, we showed that male risk carriers had an increased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity and a larger amygdala than non-risk carriers. The latter association has been replicated in an independent cohort of 121 independent subjects. Altogether, results from these multilevel functional studies are bringing strong evidence for the functional consequences of this allelic variation of SNAP25 on modulating the development and plasticity of the prefrontal-limbic network, which therefore may increase the vulnerability to both early-onset bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Functional characterization of disease-associated variants is a key challenge in understanding neuropsychiatric disorders and will open an avenue in the development of personalized treatments. Recent studies have accumulated evidence that the SNARE complex, and more specifically the SNAP25 protein, may be involved in psychiatric disorders. Here, our multilevel functional studies are bringing strong evidence for the functional consequences of an allelic variation of SNAP25 on modulating the development and plasticity of the prefrontal-limbic network. These results demonstrate a common genetically driven functional alteration of a synaptic mechanism both in schizophrenia and early-onset bipolar disorder and confirm the shared genetic vulnerability between these two disorders.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Tractography studies investigating white matter (WM) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder have yielded heterogeneous results owing to small sample sizes. The small size limits their generalizability, a critical issue for neuroimaging studies of biomarkers of bipolar I disorder (BPI).
OBJECTIVES: To study WM abnormalities using whole-brain tractography in a large international multicenter sample of BPI patients and to compare these alterations between patients with or without a history of psychotic features during mood episodes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, multicenter, international, Q-ball imaging tractography study comparing 118 BPI patients and 86 healthy control individuals. In addition, among the patient group, we compared those with and without a history of psychotic features. University hospitals in France, Germany, and the United States contributed participants.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent assessment using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies at the French sites or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV at the German and US sites. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired using the same acquisition parameters and scanning hardware at each site. We reconstructed 22 known deep WM tracts using Q-ball imaging tractography and an automatized segmentation technique.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized fractional anisotropy values along each reconstructed WM tract.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, BPI patients had significant reductions in mean generalized fractional anisotropy values along the body and the splenium of the corpus callosum, the left cingulum, and the anterior part of the left arcuate fasciculus when controlling for age, sex, and acquisition site (corrected for multiple testing). Patients with a history of psychotic features had a lower mean generalized fractional anisotropy value than those without along the body of the corpus callosum (corrected for multiple testing).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter sample, BPI patients had reduced WM integrity in interhemispheric, limbic, and arcuate WM tracts. Interhemispheric pathways are more disrupted in patients with than in those without psychotic symptoms. Together these results highlight the existence of an anatomic disconnectivity in BPI and further underscore a role for interhemispheric disconnectivity in the pathophysiological features of psychosis in BPI.},

Few multimodal neuroimaging studies allow an integrated perspective of this impact. Our goal was thus to study the effects of CT on the limbic network.
METHODS: We acquired multimodal MRI (T1, diffusion weighted, and resting state fMRI) data from 79 subjects (47 healthy controls and 32 patients with bipolar disorder, BD). We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (physical and emotional abuse/neglect and sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy).
RESULTS: We found CTQ total scores to be negatively correlated with amygdala volume, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity (FC) and uncinate fractional anisotropy in our sample. Considering subscores, neglects (physical and emotional) were the only to affect neural parameters. The patients with BD drove most of the results.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and low level of trauma in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multimodal approach enabled an integrated view of the long-term effects of CT on the limbic system.},

There is growing evidence that cerebellum plays a crucial role in cognition and emotional regulation. Cerebellum is likely to be involved in the physiopathology of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The objective of our study was to compare cerebellar size between patients with bipolar disorder, patients with schizophrenia, and healthy controls in a multicenter sample. In addition, we studied the influence of psychotic features on cerebellar size in patients with bipolar disorder.
METHOD:
One hundred and fifteen patients with bipolar I disorder, 32 patients with schizophrenia, and 52 healthy controls underwent 3 Tesla MRI. Automated segmentation of cerebellum was performed using FreeSurfer software. Volumes of cerebellar cortex and white matter were extracted. Analyses of covariance were conducted, and age, sex, and intracranial volume were considered as covariates.
RESULTS:
Bilateral cerebellar cortical volumes were smaller in patients with schizophrenia compared with patients with bipolar I disorder and healthy controls. We found no significant difference of cerebellar volume between bipolar patients with and without psychotic features. No change was evidenced in white matter.
CONCLUSION:
Our results suggest that reduction in cerebellar cortical volume is specific to schizophrenia. Cerebellar dysfunction in bipolar disorder, if present, appears to be more subtle than a reduction in cerebellar volume.},

The atlas generation method is based on a cortical parcellation for the extraction of fibers connecting two different gyri. Then, an intra-subject fiber clustering is applied, in order to divide each bundle into sub-bundles with similar shape. After that, a two-step inter-subject fiber clustering is used in order to find the correspondence between the sub-bundles across the subjects, fuse similar clusters and discard the outliers. The method was applied to 40 subjects of a high quality HARDI database, focused on the left hemisphere fronto-parietal and insula brain regions. We obtained an atlas composed of 44 bundles connecting 22 pair of ROIs. Then the atlas was used to automatically segment 39 new subjects from the database.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the relation between gaze and posture/gait control in Parkinson disease (PD) and to determine the role of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) and cortex-MLR connection in saccadic behavior because this structure is a major area involved in both gait/postural control and gaze control networks.
METHODS: We recruited 30 patients with PD with or without altered postural control and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). We assessed gait, balance, and neuropsychological status and separately recorded gait initiation and eye movements (visually guided saccades and volitional antisaccades). We identified correlations between the clinical and physiologic parameters that best characterized patients with postural instability. We measured resting-state functional connectivity in 2 pathways involving the frontal oculomotor cortices and the MLR and sought correlations with saccadic behavior.
RESULTS: Patients with PD with postural instability showed altered antisaccade latencies that correlated with the stand-walk-sit time (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.001) and the duration of anticipatory postural adjustments before gait initiation (r = 0.61, p = 0.001). Functional connectivity between the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the frontal eye field correlated with antisaccade latency in the HCs (r = -0.54, p = 0.02) but not in patients with PD.
CONCLUSIONS: In PD, impairment of antisaccade latencies, a simple and robust parameter, may be an indirect marker correlated with impaired release of anticipatory postural program. PPN alterations may account for both antisaccade and postural impairments.},

Such a reproducible localization is paradoxical, given that reading is a recent invention that could not have influenced the genetic evolution of the cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that the VWFA recycles a region of the ventral visual cortex that shows a high degree of anatomical connectivity to perisylvian language areas, thus providing an efficient circuit for both grapheme-phoneme conversion and lexical access. In two distinct experiments, using high-resolution diffusion-weighted data from 75 human subjects, we show that (1) the VWFA, compared with the fusiform face area, shows higher connectivity to left-hemispheric perisylvian superior temporal, anterior temporal and inferior frontal areas; (2) on a posterior-to-anterior axis, its localization within the left occipitotemporal sulcus maps onto a peak of connectivity with language areas, with slightly distinct subregions showing preferential projections to areas respectively involved in grapheme-phoneme conversion and lexical access. In agreement with functional data on the VWFA in blind subjects, the results suggest that connectivity to language areas, over and above visual factors, may be the primary determinant of VWFA localization.},

	abstract = {The volume fraction of water related to myelin (fmy) is a promising MRI index for in vivo assessment of brain myelination, that can be derived from multi-component analysis of T1 and T2 relaxometry signals. However, existing quantification methods require rather long acquisition and/or post-processing times, making implementation difficult both in research studies on healthy unsedated children and in clinical examinations. The goal of this work was to propose a novel strategy for fmy quantification within acceptable acquisition and post-processing times. Our approach is based on a 3-compartment model (myelin-related water, intra/extra-cellular water and unrestricted water), and uses calibrated values of inherent relaxation times (T1c and T2c) for each compartment c. Calibration was first performed on adult relaxometry datasets (N = 3) acquired with large numbers of inversion times (TI) and echo times (TE), using an original combination of a region contraction approach and a non-negative least-square (NNLS) algorithm. This strategy was compared with voxel-wise fitting, and showed robust estimation of T1c and T2c. The accuracy of fmy calculations depending on multiple factors was investigated using simulated data. In the testing stage, our strategy enabled fast fmy mapping, based on relaxometry datasets acquired with reduced TI and TE numbers (acquisition {\textless}6 min), and analyzed with NNLS algorithm (post-processing {\textless}5min). In adults (N = 13, mean age 22.4±1.6 years), fmy maps showed variability across white matter regions, in agreement with previous studies. In healthy infants (N = 18, aged 3 to 34 weeks), asynchronous changes in fmy values were demonstrated across bundles, confirming the well-known progression of myelination.},

	abstract = {Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yields noisy magnitude data, described in most cases as following a noncentral χ distribution when the signals received by the coils are combined as the sum of their squares. One well-known case of this noncentral χ noise model is the Rician model, but it is only valid in the case of single-channel acquisition. Although the use of parallel MRI is increasingly common, most of the correction methods still perform Rician noise removal, yielding an erroneous result due to an incorrect noise model. Moreover, the existence of noise correlations in phased array systems renders noise nonstationary and further modifies the noise description in parallel MRI. However, the noncentral χ model has been demonstrated to work as a good approximation as long as effective voxelwise parameters are used. A good correction step, adapted to the right noise model, is of paramount importance, especially when working with diffusion-weighted MR data, whose signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this paper, we present a noise removal technique designed to be fast enough for integration into a real-time reconstruction system, thus offering the convenience of obtaining corrected data almost instantaneously during the MRI scan. Our method employs the noncentral χ noise model and uses a simplified method to account for noise correlations; this leads to an efficient and rapid correction. The method consists of an anisotropic extension of the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (LMMSE) that is a far better edge-preserving method than the traditional LMMSE and addresses noncentral χ distributions along with empirically computed global effective parameters. The results on simulated and real data demonstrate that this anisotropic extended LMMSE outperforms the original LMMSE on images corrupted by noncentral χ noise. Moreover, in comparison with the existing LMMSE technique incorporating the estimation of voxelwise effective parameters, our method yields improved results.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-based tractography is an ill-posed problem, because the step-by-step reconstruction of a fibre bundle trajectory cannot afford any serious mistake in the evaluation of the local fibre orientations. Such evaluation is difficult, however, because the myriad fibres passing through a single voxel follow different directions. Modelling tractography as a global inverse problem is a simple framework which addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem. The key idea is that the results of tractography in the neighbourhood of an ambiguous local diffusion profile can help to infer the local fibre directions. This paper provides an overview of past achievements of global tractography and proposes guidelines for a future research programme in the hope that the potential of the technique will increase the interest of the community.},

This paper presents a groupwise connectivity-based parcellation framework for the whole cortical surface using a new high quality diffusion dataset of 79 healthy subjects. Our approach performs gyrus by gyrus to parcellate the whole human cortex. The main originality of the method is to compress for each gyrus the connectivity profiles used for the clustering without any anatomical prior information. This step takes into account the interindividual cortical and connectivity variability. To this end, we consider intersubject high density connectivity areas extracted using a surface-based watershed algorithm. A wide validation study has led to a fully automatic pipeline which is robust to variations in data preprocessing (tracking type, cortical mesh characteristics and boundaries of initial gyri), data characteristics (including number of subjects), and the main algorithmic parameters. A remarkable reproducibility is achieved in parcellation results for the whole cortex, leading to clear and stable cortical patterns. This reproducibility has been tested across non-overlapping subgroups and the validation is presented mainly on the pre- and postcentral gyri.},

The aims of DMS are to give insights into the link between the fundamental diffusion process in biological tissues and the features observed in dMRI, as well as to provide appropriate ground-truth information for the development, optimization, and validation of dMRI acquisition schemes for different applications. The validity, efficiency, and potential applications of DMS are evaluated through four benchmark experiments, including the simulated dMRI of white matter fibers, the multiple scattering diffusion imaging, the biophysical modeling of polar cell membranes, and the high angular resolution diffusion imaging and fiber tractography of complex fiber configurations.

Recent applications of diffusion MRI aimed to characterize the structural connectome using tractography to infer connectivity between brain regions. In parallel to the development of tractography, additional diffusion MRI based frameworks (CHARMED, AxCaliber, ActiveAx) were developed enabling the extraction of a multitude of micro-structural parameters (axon diameter distribution, mean axonal diameter and axonal density). This unique insight into both tissue microstructure and connectivity has enormous potential value in understanding the structure and organization of the brain as well as providing unique insights to abnormalities that underpin disease states. The CONNECT (Consortium Of Neuroimagers for the Non-invasive Exploration of brain Connectivity and Tracts) project aimed to combine tractography and micro-structural measures of the living human brain in order to obtain a better estimate of the connectome, while also striving to extend validation of these measurements. This paper summarizes the project and describes the perspective of using micro-structural measures to study the connectome.},

While the lateralization of the VWFA fits with the leftward asymmetry of the speech processing network, origin of the rightward asymmetry for faces is still unclear. Using fMRI data from 64 subjects (including 16 monozygotic (MZ) and 13 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs), we investigated how activations evoked by written words, faces, and spoken language are co-lateralized in the temporal lobe, and whether this organization reflects genetic factors or individual reading expertise. We found that the lateralization of the left superior temporal activation for spoken language correlates with the lateralization of occipitotemporal activations for both written words and faces. Behavioral reading scores also modulate the responses to words and faces. Estimation of genetic and environmental contributions shows that activations of the VWFA, the occipital face area, and the temporal speech areas are partially under genetic control whereas activation of the FFA is primarily influenced by individual experience. Our results stress the importance of both genetic factors and acquired expertise in the occipitotemporal organization.},

In order to analyze the quality of the estimation in a controlled way, we generated synthetic noisy dMRI signals by including the effect of noise on the exact signal produced by the Finite Pulse Kärger model. The noisy signals were then fitted using the macroscopic model. Minimizing the least squares, we estimated the model parameters. The bias and standard deviations of the estimated model parameters as a function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) were obtained.

The analysis was applied to two independent groups of 37 subjects. Results between the two groups were compared, in order to keep reproducible connections for the atlas creation. The method was applied using linear and non-linear registration, where the non-linear registration showed significantly better results. A final atlas with 35 bundles in the left hemisphere and 27 in the right hemisphere from the whole brain was obtained.

	abstract = {The current theory implying local, short-range overconnectivity in autism spectrum disorder, contrasting with long-range underconnectivity, is based on heterogeneous results, on limited data involving functional connectivity studies, on heterogeneous paediatric populations and non-specific methodologies. In this work, we studied short-distance structural connectivity in a homogeneous population of males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and used a novel methodology specifically suited for assessing U-shaped short-distance tracts, including a recently developed tractography-based atlas of the superficial white matter fibres. We acquired diffusion-weighted MRI for 58 males (27 subjects with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and 31 control subjects) and extracted the mean generalized fractional anisotropy of 63 short-distance tracts. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV), Communication Checklist-Adult, Empathy Quotient, Social Responsiveness Scale and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). In contradiction with the models of short-range over-connectivity in autism spectrum disorder, we found that patients with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly decreased anatomical connectivity in a component comprising 13 short tracts compared to controls. Specific short-tract atypicalities in temporal lobe and insula were significantly associated with clinical manifestations of autism spectrum disorder such as social awareness, language structure, pragmatic skills and empathy, emphasizing their importance in social dysfunction. Short-range decreased anatomical connectivity may thus be an important substrate of social deficits in autism spectrum disorder, in contrast with current models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several new MR imaging techniques have shown promising results in patients with Parkinson disease; however, the comparative diagnostic values of these measures at the individual level remain unclear. Our aim was to compare the diagnostic value of MR imaging biomarkers of substantia nigra damage for distinguishing patients with Parkinson disease from healthy volunteers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients and 20 healthy volunteers were prospectively included. The MR imaging protocol at 3T included 3D T2-weighted and T1-weighted neuromelanin-sensitive images, diffusion tensor images, and R2* mapping. T2* high-resolution images were also acquired at 7T to evaluate the dorsal nigral hyperintensity sign. Quantitative analysis was performed using ROIs in the substantia nigra drawn manually around the area of high signal intensity on neuromelanin-sensitive images and T2-weighted images. Visual analysis of the substantia nigra neuromelanin-sensitive signal intensity and the dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity on T2* images was performed.
RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the neuromelanin-sensitive volume and signal intensity in patients with Parkinson disease. There was also a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra at 3T and a decrease in substantia nigra volume on T2* images. The combination of substantia nigra volume, signal intensity, and fractional anisotropy in the neuromelanin-sensitive substantia nigra allowed excellent diagnostic accuracy (0.93). Visual assessment of both substantia nigra dorsolateral hyperintensity and neuromelanin-sensitive images had good diagnostic accuracy (0.91 and 0.86, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of neuromelanin signal and volume changes with fractional anisotropy measurements in the substantia nigra showed excellent diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the high diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment of substantia nigra changes using dorsolateral hyperintensity analysis or neuromelanin-sensitive signal changes indicates that these techniques are promising for clinical practice.},

Neurodevelopmental disorders involve morphological and organizational alterations which cannot be jointly captured by usual shape analysis techniques based on single diffeomorphisms. We propose a new deformation scheme, called double diffeomorphism, which is a combination of two diffeomorphisms. The first one captures changes in structural connectivity, whereas the second one recovers the global morphological variations of both grey and white matter structures. This deformation model is integrated into a Bayesian framework for atlas construction. We evaluate it on a data-set of 3-D structures representing the neural circuits of patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). We show that this approach makes it possible to localise, quantify, and easily visualise the pathological anomalies altering the morphology and organization of the neural circuits. Furthermore, results also indicate that the proposed deformation model better discriminates between controls and GTS patients than a single diffeomorphism.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Quantifying multiple NMR properties of sodium could be of benefit to assess changes in cellular viability in biological tissues. A proof of concept of Quantitative Imaging using Configuration States (QuICS) based on a SSFP sequence with multiple contrasts was implemented to extract simultaneously 3D maps of applied flip angle (FA), total sodium concentration, T1, T2, and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC).
METHODS: A 3D Cartesian Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) sequence was used to acquire 11 non-balanced SSFP contrasts at a 6 × 6 × 6 mm3 isotropic resolution with carefully-chosen gradient spoiling area, RF amplitude and phase cycling, with TR/TE = 20/3.2 ms and 25 averages, leading to a total acquisition time of 1 h 18 min. A least-squares fit between the measured and the analytical complex signals was performed to extract quantitative maps from a mono-exponential model. Multiple sodium phantoms with different compositions were studied to validate the ability of the method to measure sodium NMR properties in various conditions.
RESULTS: Flip angle maps were retrieved. Relaxation times, ADC and sodium concentrations were estimated with controlled precision below 15\%, and were in accordance with measurements from established methods and literature.
CONCLUSION: The results illustrate the ability to retrieve sodium NMR properties maps, which is a first step toward the estimation of FA, T1, T2, concentration and ADC of 23Na for clinical research. With further optimization of the acquired QuICS contrasts, scan time could be reduced to be suitable with in vivo applications.},

	abstract = {In today's society, every individual is subjected to stressful stimuli with different intensities and duration. This exposure can be a key trigger in several mental illnesses greatly affecting one's quality of life. Yet not all subjects respond equally to the same stimulus and some are able to better adapt to them delaying the onset of its negative consequences. The neural specificities of this adaptation can be essential to understand the true dynamics of stress as well as to design new approaches to reduce its consequences. In the current work, we employed ex vivo high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to uncover the differences in white matter properties in the entire brain between Fisher 344 (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, known to present different responses to stress, and to examine the effects of a 2-week repeated inescapable stress paradigm. We applied a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis approach to a total of 25 animals. After exposure to stress, SD rats were found to have lower values of corticosterone when compared with F344 rats. Overall, stress was found to lead to an overall increase in fractional anisotropy (FA), on top of a reduction in mean and radial diffusivity (MD and RD) in several white matter bundles of the brain. No effect of strain on the white matter diffusion properties was observed. The strain-by-stress interaction revealed an effect on SD rats in MD, RD and axial diffusivity (AD), with lower diffusion metric levels on stressed animals. These effects were localized on the left side of the brain on the external capsule, corpus callosum, deep cerebral white matter, anterior commissure, endopiriform nucleus, dorsal hippocampus and amygdala fibers. The results possibly reveal an adaptation of the SD strain to the stressful stimuli through synaptic and structural plasticity processes, possibly reflecting learning processes.},

	abstract = {The development of the human brain is a complex process that starts during early pregnancy and extends until the end of adolescence. In parallel to morphological changes in brain size and gyrification, several microstructural changes occur in the cortex, such as the development of dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis and pruning, and fiber myelination. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide indirect markers of these mechanisms through the mapping of quantitative parameters. Here, we used a dedicated methodological framework to perform reliable voxel-wise analyses over the infant cortex. The examination of hemispheric asymmetries in microstructure required careful alignment of morphological asymmetries through registration of native and flipped brains using a 2-step matching strategy of sulci (DISCO approach) and cortical ribbon (DAR℡ approach). We tested the potential of this approach in 1-to-5-month-old infants, with a focus on cortical longitudinal diffusivity from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). This enabled us to unravel different microstructural evolution patterns of specific sensorimotor and language regions in the left and right hemispheres.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Diffusion MRI tractography (dMRI) has fundamentally transformed our ability to investigate white matter pathways in the human brain. While long-range connections have been extensively studied, short-range white matter bundles (SWMBs) have remained a relatively underexplored aspect of brain connectivity. This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of SWMB connectivity in both the human and chimpanzee brains, employing a novel combination of empirical and geometric methodologies to classify SWMB morphology in an objective manner. Leveraging two anatomical atlases, the Ginkgo Chauvel chimpanzee atlas and the Ginkgo Chauvel human atlas, comprising respectively 844 and 1375 superficial bundles, this research focuses on sparse representations of the morphology of SWMBs to explore the little-understood superficial connectivity of the chimpanzee brain and facilitate a deeper understanding of the variability in shape of these bundles. Ultimately, the analysis aims to uncover both commonalities and disparities in SWMBs between chimpanzees and humans, shedding light on the evolution and organization of these crucial neural structures.},

              Background
              Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) have been increasingly viewed as psychotic mood disorders along a shared spectrum. Long-range and short-range structural connectivity have been implicated in both disorders, conceptualising them as “disconnection syndromes”. There has been a rise in neuroimaging tools to understand the overlap and boundaries between the two disorders, which has shifted our focus towards appreciating traits in addition to diagnosis. Our recent pilot study examining short-range U-fibers found in superficial white matter (SWM) found shared and distinct traits among people with SZ and BD and we aimed to investigate SWM further using data from the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) consortium.
            
            
              Methods
              Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), we performed whole brain tractography in 113 people with SZ, 69 people with SA disorder, 49 people with psychotic BD and 77 healthy controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labelling of SWM tracts were performed using a comprehensive U-fiber atlas. ComBat was applied to remove site effects and principle components analysis was performed to identity networks of bundles used for comparative analyses.
            
            
              Results
              Principle component analysis revealed a network comprised of 8 short tracts in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions that had decreased anatomical connectivity in patients, regardless of diagnosis, relative to healthy controls. This network overlaps, in part, regions that differed between patients (SZ and BD) and healthy controls in our recent pilot study. However, we were unable to detect differences between people with SZ, SA disorder and psychotic BD.
            
            
              Discussion
              We demonstrate that short U-fibers are likely vulnerable to pathological processes in psychotic illnesses, encouraging further understanding of their anatomy and function. Our lack of findings between patient groups may reflect a more homogeneous population (three subgroups of psychosis) and may suggest that abnormalities in SWM are less likely due to mood disturbances.},

              Background
              Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative clinically heterogeneous disorder, formal diagnosis being based on postmortem histological brain examination.
            
            
              Objective
              We aimed to perform a precise in vivo staging of neurodegeneration in PSP using quantitative multimodal MRI. The ability of MRI biomarkers to differentiate PSP from PD was also evaluated.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Eleven PSP patients were compared to 26 age‐matched healthy controls and 51 PD patients. Images were acquired at 3 Tesla (three‐dimensional T
                1
                ‐weighted, diffusion tensor, and neuromelanin‐sensitive images) and 7 Tesla (three‐dimensional‐T
                2
                * images). Regions of interest included the cortical areas, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, brainstem nuclei, dentate nucleus, and cerebellum. Volumes, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were measured. In each region, a threshold value for group categorization was calculated, and four grades of change (0–3) were determined.
              
            
            
              Results
              PSP patients showed extensive volume decreases and diffusion changes in the midbrain, SN, STN, globus pallidus, basal forebrain, locus coeruleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, and dentate nucleus, in close agreement with the degrees of impairment in histological analyses. The predictive factors for the separation of PSP and healthy controls were, in descending order, the neuromelanin‐based SN volume; midbrain fractional anisotropy; volumes of the midbrain, globus pallidus, and putamen; and fractional anisotropy in the locus coeruleus. The best predictors for separating PSP from PD were the neuromelanin‐based volume in the SN, fractional anisotropy in the pons, volumes of the midbrain and globus pallidus, and fractional anisotropy in the basal forebrain.
            
            
              Conclusions
              These results suggest that it is possible to evaluate brain neurodegeneration in PSP noninvasively, even in small brainstem nuclei, in close agreement with previously published histological data. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

              Background
              Current demographic trends point towards an aging society entailing increasing occurrence and burden of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, understanding physiological aging and its turning point into neurodegeneration is essential for the development of possible biomarkers and future therapeutics of brain disease.
            
            
              Methods
              The SENIOR study represents a longitudinal, observational study including cognitively healthy elderlies aged between 50 and 70 years old at the time of inclusion, being followed annually over 10 years. Our multimodal protocol includes structural, diffusion, functional, and sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T and 7 T, positron emission tomography (PET), blood samples, genetics, audiometry, and neuropsychological and neurological examinations as well as assessment of neuronal risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              One hundred forty-two participants (50\% females) were enrolled in the SENIOR cohort with a mean age of 60 (SD 6.3) years at baseline. Baseline results with multiple regression analyses reveal that cerebral white matter lesions can be predicted by cardiovascular and cognitive risk factors and age. Cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with juxtacortical and periventricular lesions. Intra-subject across-test variability as a measure of neuropsychological test performance and possible cognitive marker predicts white matter volume and is significantly associated with risk profile. Division of the cohort into subjects with a higher and lower risk profile shows significant differences in intra-subject across-test variability and volumes as well as cortical thickness of brain regions of the temporal lobe. There is no difference between the lower- and higher-risk groups in amyloid load using PET data from a subset of 81 subjects.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated, multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We show that intra-subject across-test variability as a marker of neuropsychological test performance as well as age, gender, and combined risk factors influence neuronal decline as represented by decrease in brain volume, cortical thickness, and increase in white matter lesions. Baseline findings will be used as underlying basis for the further implications of aging and neuronal degeneration as well as examination of brain aging under different aspects of brain pathology versus physiological aging.},

              Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography is currently the only imaging technique that allows for non-invasive delineation and visualisation of white matter (WM) tracts
              in vivo,
              prompting rapid advances in related fields of brain MRI research in recent years. One of its major clinical applications is for pre-surgical planning and intraoperative image guidance in neurosurgery, where knowledge about the location of WM tracts nearby the surgical target can be helpful to guide surgical resection and optimise post-surgical outcomes. Surgical injuries to these WM tracts can lead to permanent neurological and functional deficits, making the accuracy of tractography reconstructions paramount. The quality of dMRI tractography is influenced by many modifiable factors, ranging from MRI data acquisition through to the post-processing of tractography output, with the potential of error propagation based on decisions made at each and subsequent processing steps. Research over the last 25 years has significantly improved the anatomical accuracy of tractography. An updated review about tractography methodology in the context of neurosurgery is now timely given the thriving research activities in dMRI, to ensure more appropriate applications in the clinical neurosurgical realm. This article aims to review the dMRI physics, and tractography methodologies, highlighting recent advances to provide the key concepts of tractography-informed neurosurgery, with a focus on the general considerations, the current state of practice, technical challenges, potential advances, and future demands to this field.},

            Reversible detyrosination of tubulin, the building block of microtubules, is crucial for neuronal physiology. Enzymes responsible for detyrosination were recently identified as complexes of vasohibins (VASHs) one or two with small VASH-binding protein (SVBP). Here we report three consanguineous families, each containing multiple individuals with biallelic inactivation of SVBP caused by truncating variants (p.Q28* and p.K13Nfs*18). Affected individuals show brain abnormalities with microcephaly, intellectual disability and delayed gross motor and speech development. Immunoblot testing in cells with pathogenic SVBP variants demonstrated that the encoded proteins were unstable and non-functional, resulting in a complete loss of VASH detyrosination activity. Svbp knockout mice exhibit drastic accumulation of tyrosinated tubulin and a reduction of detyrosinated tubulin in brain tissue. Similar alterations in tubulin tyrosination levels were observed in cultured neurons and associated with defects in axonal differentiation and architecture. Morphological analysis of the Svbp knockout mouse brains by anatomical magnetic resonance imaging showed a broad impact of SVBP loss, with a 7\% brain volume decrease, numerous structural defects and a 30\% reduction of some white matter tracts. Svbp knockout mice display behavioural defects, including mild hyperactivity, lower anxiety and impaired social behaviour. They do not, however, show prominent memory defects. Thus, SVBP-deficient mice recapitulate several features observed in human patients. Altogether, our data demonstrate that deleterious variants in SVBP cause this neurodevelopmental pathology, by leading to a major change in brain tubulin tyrosination and alteration of microtubule dynamics and neuron physiology.},

            Neuroimaging evidence implicates structural network-level abnormalities in bipolar disorder (BD); however, there remain conflicting results in the current literature hampered by sample size limitations and clinical heterogeneity. Here, we set out to perform a multisite graph theory analysis to assess the extent of neuroanatomical dysconnectivity in a large representative study of individuals with BD.
            This cross-sectional multicenter international study assessed structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from 109 subjects with BD type 1 and 103 psychiatrically healthy volunteers.
            Whole-brain metrics, permutation-based statistics, and connectivity of highly connected nodes were used to compare network-level connectivity patterns in individuals with BD compared with controls.
            The BD group displayed longer characteristic path length, a weakly connected left frontotemporal network, and increased rich-club dysconnectivity compared with healthy controls.
            Our multisite findings implicate emotion and reward networks dysconnectivity in bipolar illness and may guide larger scale global efforts in understanding how human brain architecture impacts mood regulation in BD.},

              Background
              Diffusion MRI is the preferred non-invasive in vivo modality for the study of brain white matter connections. Tractography datasets contain 3D streamlines that can be analyzed to study the main brain white matter tracts. Fiber clustering methods have been used to automatically group similar fibers into clusters. However, due to inter-subject variability and artifacts, the resulting clusters are difficult to process for finding common connections across subjects, specially for superficial white matter.
            
            
              Methods
              We present an automatic method for labeling of short association bundles on a group of subjects. The method is based on an intra-subject fiber clustering that generates compact fiber clusters. Posteriorly, the clusters are labeled based on the cortical connectivity of the fibers, taking as reference the Desikan–Killiany atlas, and named according to their relative position along one axis. Finally, two different strategies were applied and compared for the labeling of inter-subject bundles: a matching with the Hungarian algorithm, and a well-known fiber clustering algorithm, called QuickBundles.
            
            
              Results
              Individual labeling was executed over four subjects, with an execution time of 3.6 min. An inspection of individual labeling based on a distance measure showed good correspondence among the four tested subjects. Two inter-subject labeling were successfully implemented and applied to 20 subjects and compared using a set of distance thresholds, ranging from a conservative value of 10 mm to a moderate value of 21 mm. Hungarian algorithm led to a high correspondence, but low reproducibility for all the thresholds, with 96 s of execution time. QuickBundles led to better correspondence, reproducibility and short execution time of 9 s. Hence, the whole processing for the inter-subject labeling over 20 subjects takes 1.17 h.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We implemented a method for the automatic labeling of short bundles in individuals, based on an intra-subject clustering and the connectivity of the clusters with the cortex. The labels provide useful information for the visualization and analysis of individual connections, which is very difficult without any additional information. Furthermore, we provide two fast inter-subject bundle labeling methods. The obtained clusters could be used for performing manual or automatic connectivity analysis in individuals or across subjects.},

              Bipolar disorder has been repeatedly associated with abnormalities of white matter. However, DTI is intrinsically limited and the precise cellular mechanisms that underlie these alterations remains unknown.
            
            
              Objectives
              Our aim was to investigate microscopical characteristics of white matter using MRI in patients with bipolar and healthy controls.
            
            
              Methods
              77 patients and 71 controls from 3 sites had a T1 structural MRI, a multi-shell HARDI MRI and at one site with a T1-weighted VFA-SPGR acquisition, and a T2 MSME acquisition. The volume fraction and the orientation dispersion was extracted using NODDI from DW images in each site. Myelin Water Fraction was extracted in 33 patients and 36 controls to probe myelin characteristics. White matter bundles were reconstructed using deterministic tractography. Statistical analyses were performed after harmonization by the ComBat algorithm and controlled for age, gender and handedness.
            
            
              Results
              We found significant lower axonal density in patients along the short fibers of the left cingulum, the left anterior arcuate and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. We found lower mean MWF in patients along the short fibers of the right cingulum, the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the left anterior arcuate and the splenium of the corpus callosum. We found higher mean orientation dispersion in patients only along the left uncinate fasciculus.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We report alterations of limbic and inter-hemispheric white matter tracts in patients with bipolar disorder reflecting axonal loss, demyelination and architecture alterations. These results contribute to better capture the plurality of the mechanisms involved in bipolar disorder that cannot be deciphered with classical diffusion MRI.

              The structural connectivity of animal brains can be revealed using post-mortem diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite the existence of several structural atlases of avian brains, few of them address the bird’s structural connectivity. In this study, a novel atlas of the structural connectivity is proposed for the male Japanese quail (
              Coturnix japonica
              ), aiming at investigating two lines divergent on their emotionality trait: the short tonic immobility (STI) and the long tonic immobility (LTI) lines. The STI line presents a low emotionality trait, while the LTI line expresses a high emotionality trait. 21 male Japanese quail brains from both lines were scanned post-mortem for this study, using a preclinical Bruker 11.7 T MRI scanner. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed using a 3D segmented echo planar imaging (EPI) pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) sequence with a 200

	abstract = {Each variation of the cortical folding pattern implies a particular rearrangement of the geometry of the fibers of the underlying white matter. While this rearrangement only impacts the ends of the long pathways, it may affect most of the trajectory of the short bundles. Therefore, mapping the short fibers of the human brain using diffusion-based tractography requires a dedicated strategy to overcome the variability of the folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a fiber-based stratification strategy splitting the population into homogeneous groups for disentangling the superficial white matter bundle organization. This strategy introduces a new refined fiber distance which includes angular considerations for inferring fine-grained atlases of the short bundles surrounding a specific sulcus and a subtractogram distance that quantifies the similitude between fiber sets of two different subjects. The stratification splits the population into groups with similar regional fiber organization using manifold learning. We first successfully test the hypothesis that the main source of variability of the regional fiber organization is the variability of the regional folding pattern. Then, in each group, we proceed with the automatic identification of the most stable bundles, at a higher granularity level than what can be achieved with the non-stratified whole population, enabling the disentanglement of the very variable configuration of the short fibers. Finally, the method searches for bundle correspondence across groups to build a population level atlas.

	abstract = {The study of short association fibers is still an incomplete task due to their higher inter-subject variability and the smaller size of this kind of fibers in comparison to known long association bundles. However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases. Results for deterministic and probabilistic tractography data show high reproducibility, especially for probabilistic tractography in HCP data. In comparison to previous work, our atlas features a higher number of bundles and greater cortical surface coverage.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new cortical parcellation method based on group-wise connectivity and hierarchical clustering. A preliminary sub-parcellation is performed using intra-subject and inter-subject fiber clustering to obtain representative bundles among subjects with similar shapes and trajectories. The sub-parcellation is obtained by intersecting fiber clusters with cortical meshes. Next, mean connectivity and mean overlap matrices are computed over the sub-parcels to obtain spatial and connectivity information. To hierarchize the information, we propose to weight both matrices, to obtain an affinity graph, and then a dendrogram to merge or divide parcels by their hierarchy. Finally, to obtain homogeneous parcels, the method computes morphological operations. By selecting a different number of clusters over the dendrogram, the method obtains a different number of parcels and a variation in the resulting parcel sizes, depending on the parameters used. We computed the coefficient of variation (CV ) of the parcel size to evaluate the homogeneity of the parcels. Preliminary results suggest that the use of representative clusters and the integration of sub-parcel overlap and connectivity strength provide useful information to generate cortical parcellations at different levels of granularity. Even results are preliminary, this novel method allows researchers to add group-wise connectivity strength and spatial information for the construction of diffusion-based parcellations. Future work will include a detailed analysis of parameters, such as the matrix weights and the number of sub-parcel clusters, and the generation of hierarchical parcellations to improve the insight into the cortex subdivision and hierarchy among parcels.},

	abstract = {Currently, there are many methods for processing diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography data, with the aim to identify the main white matter connections. However, methods like fiber clustering lack ground truth, making the evaluation of the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms problematic. An alternative to evaluate the performance and test the efficacy of these algorithms is to use simulated fiber datasets. Nevertheless, the simulation of this data is not trivial due to brain fibers’ irregular and complex shape. Although many fiber bundle simulators exist, they have been developed for other purposes, such as validating tractography algorithms or local diffusion models. In addition, these simulators usually use simple fiber bundle configurations without considering complex bundle shapes. With this in mind, the main goal of this work is to implement a simulator of brain fiber bundles based on exponential curves for validating fiber clustering methods. This representation uses bundle centroids and shape parameters to obtain a more realistic appearance of the fascicles. The simulator was validated using a deep white matter fiber bundle atlas, obtaining a good percentage of intersection between the original and simulated bundles, of up to 82\%. Furthermore, we used groups of simulated bundles for the whole brain to evaluate the performance of a fiber clustering algorithm (QuickBundles) when using different distance thresholds, showing the utility of the proposed simulator.},

Diffusion MRI experiments using oscillating gradient spin echo sequences have shown that the diffusivity transverse to axons in this extra-axonal space is dependent on the frequency of the employed sequence. In this study, we observe the same frequency-dependence using 3D simulations of the diffusion process in disordered media. We design a novel white matter numerical phantom generation algorithm which constructs biomimicking geometric configurations with few design parameters, and enables to control the level of disorder of the generated phantoms. The influence of various geometrical parameters present in white matter, such as global angular dispersion, tortuosity, presence of Ranvier nodes, beading, on the extra-cellular perpendicular diffusivity frequency dependence was investigated by simulating the diffusion process in numerical phantoms of increasing complexity and fitting the resulting simulated diffusion MR signal attenuation with an adequate analytical model designed for trapezoidal OGSE sequences. This work suggests that angular dispersion and especially beading have non-negligible effects on this extracellular diffusion metrics that may be measured using standard OGSE DW-MRI clinical protocols.},

	abstract = {The human hippocampus plays a key role in memory management and is one of the first structures affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging provides access to its inner structure in vivo. However, gradient limitations on clinical systems hinder access to its inner connectivity and microstructure. A major target of this paper is the demonstration of diffusion MRI potential, using ultra-high field (11.7 T) and strong gradients (750 mT/m), to reveal the extra- and intra-hippocampal connectivity in addition to its microstructure. To this purpose, a multiple-shell diffusion-weighted acquisition protocol was developed to reach an ultra-high spatio-angular resolution with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The MRI data set was analyzed using analytical Q-Ball Imaging, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging models. High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging estimates allowed us to obtain an accurate tractography resolving more complex fiber architecture than DTI models, and subsequently provided a map of the cross-regional connectivity. The neurite density was akin to that found in the histological literature, revealing the three hippocampal layers. Moreover, a gradient of connectivity and neurite density was observed between the anterior and the posterior part of the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that ex vivo ultra-high field/ultra-high gradients diffusion-weighted MRI allows the mapping of the inner connectivity of the human hippocampus, its microstructure, and to accurately reconstruct elements of the polysynaptic intra-hippocampal pathway using fiber tractography techniques at very high spatial/angular resolutions.},

We show that this strategy is efficient with a heterogeneous dataset including challenging data as preterm newborns, infants, post mortem histological data and a synthetic atlas computed from averaging the ICBM database, as well as more commonly studied data acquired in vivo in adults.

	abstract = {While the main neural networks are in place at term birth, intense changes in cortical microstructure occur during early infancy with the development of dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis and fiber myelination. These maturational processes are thought to relate to behavioral acquisitions and the development of cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, in vivo investigations of such relationships are still lacking in healthy infants. To bridge this gap, we aimed to study the cortical maturation using non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging, over a largely unexplored period (1–5 post-natal months). In a first univariate step, we focused on different quantitative parameters: longitudinal relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2), and axial diffusivity from diffusion tensor imaging (λ//) These individual maps, acquired with echo-planar imaging to limit the acquisition time, showed spatial distortions that were first corrected to reliably match the thin cortical ribbon identified on high-resolution T2-weighted images. Averaged maps were also computed over the infants group to summarize the parameter characteristics during early infancy. In a second step, we considered a multi-parametric approach that leverages parameters complementarity, avoids reliance on pre-defined regions of interest, and does not require spatial constraints. Our clustering strategy allowed us to group cortical voxels over all infants in 5 clusters with distinct microstructural T1 and λ// properties The cluster maps over individual cortical surfaces and over the group were in sound agreement with benchmark post mortem studies of sub-cortical white matter myelination, showing a progressive maturation of 1) primary sensori-motor areas, 2) adjacent unimodal associative cortices, and 3) higher-order associative regions. This study thus opens a consistent approach to study cortical maturation in vivo.},

This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labeling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory, and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have been widely used to explore the associations between brain areas. Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often “static” despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time, moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity.},

The method is able to obtain fiber clusters that are representative of the population. The proposed approach first applies a fast intra-subject clustering algorithm on each subject obtaining the cluster centroids for all subjects. Second, it compresses the collection of centroids to a latent space through the encoder of a trained autoencoder. Finally, it uses a modified HDBSCAN with adjusted parameters on the encoded centroids of all subjects to obtain the final inter-subject clusters. The results shows that the proposed method outperforms other clustering strategies, and it is able to retrieve known fascicles in a reasonable execution time, achieving a precision over 87\% and F1 score above 86\% on a collection of 20 simulated subjects.},

	abstract = {We present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can give a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. Then, a parcellation algorithm is performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, it considers the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈ 0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈ 0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥ 0.5.},

	abstract = {Automated methods that can identify white matter bundles from large tractography datasets have several applications in neuroscience research. In these applications, clustering algorithms have shown to play an important role in the analysis and visualization of white matter structure, generating useful data which can be the basis for further studies. This work proposes FFClust, an efficient fiber clustering method for large tractography datasets containing millions of fibers. Resulting clusters describe the whole set of main white matter fascicles present on an individual brain. The method aims to identify compact and homogeneous clusters, which enables several applications. In individuals, the clusters can be used to study the local connectivity in pathological brains, while at population level, the processing and analysis of reproducible bundles, and other post-processing algorithms can be carried out to study the brain connectivity and create new white matter bundle atlases. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of quality and execution time performance versus the state-of-the-art clustering techniques used in the area. Results show that FFClust is effective in the creation of compact clusters, with a low intra-cluster distance, while keeping a good quality Davies–Bouldin index, which is a metric that quantifies the quality of clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is about 8.6 times faster than the most efficient state-of-the-art method for one million fibers dataset. In addition, we show that FFClust is able to correctly identify atlas bundles connecting different brain regions, as an example of application and the utility of compact clusters.},

In Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics [1], we have recently published the first study showing increased neurite density in patients taking lithium with Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), an advanced model of MRI diffusion [2]. Albeit confirming previous results associating lithium with changes of grey matter volume [3], replication remains a priority in the field of neuroscience [4].Here, we report a replication of our previous results – higher neurite density within the left frontal cortex – in patients under lithium therapy compared with patients without lithium therapy, in a completely independent sample. Data were collected in Calgary (AB, Canada) from 23 controls and 26 patients with bipolar disorder upon which only 7 (26.9\%) were prescribed with lithium at the time of scan. MRI data were acquired with a General Electric MR750 3T device and included T1 structural MRI (MPRAGE, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm), and multi-shell, high angular resolution diffusion MRI (EPI, 96 × 96 × 60, voxel size: 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 mm), 98 gradient directions, 3 b-shells: b = 300, 700, and 2,000 mm2/s (8, 30, and 60 directions, respectively) and 10 b = 0 mm2/s images (1, 3, and 6 per shell, respectively). Both the MRI manufacturer and the diffusion weighted acquisition (number of directions, b values) were different from the original publication [1]. The sole measure of interest was the mean intracellular fraction within the left frontal cortex as defined by the Desikan-Killiany atlas [1].},

However, the study of these fibers is still an incomplete task due to the high inter-subject variability and the size of this kind of fibers. In this work, a superficial white matter bundle identification based on fiber clustering was performed using probabilistic tractography on 100 subjects from the The Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, aligned with a non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering, followed by a segmentation of fibers connecting the precentral (PrC) and postcentral (PoC) regions, based on a ROI atlas. Due to the high amount of fibers, they were randomly separated into groups. An inter-subject clustering was applied on the fibers of each group, and then two clustering levels were applied to select the most reproducible bundles. Seven bundles per hemisphere were obtained, connecting the PrC and PoC regions. These were compared with bundles from previous atlases, showing in general more coverage and some bundles not found in previous atlases.},

These methods enable exploratory bundle inspection using visualization and other methods that require identifying brain white matter structures in individuals or a population. Some applications, such as real-time visualization and inter-subject clustering, need fast and high-quality intra-subject clustering algorithms. This work proposes a parallel algorithm using a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) for fiber clustering based on the FFClust algorithm. The proposed GPGPU implementation exploits data parallelism using both multicore and GPU fine-grained parallelism present in commodity architectures, including current laptops and desktop computers. Our approach implements all FFClust steps in parallel, improving execution times in all of them. In addition, our parallel approach includes a parallel Kmeans++ algorithm implementation and defines a new variant of Kmeans++ to reduce the impact of choosing outliers as initial centroids. The results show that our approach provides clustering quality results very similar to FFClust, and it requires an execution time of 3.5 seconds for processing about a million fibers, achieving a speedup of 11.5 times compared to FFClust.},

	abstract = {White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.},

Two inter-subject clustering schemes were tested, generating a total of 171 and 109 parcels, respectively. The resulting parcels were quantitatively compared with three state-of-the-art atlases. The best parcellation returned 69 parcels with a Dice similarity coefficient greater than 0.5.

	abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced algorithm for automatic segmentation of superficial white matter (SWM) bundles from probabilistic dMRI tractography datasets, based on a multi-subject bundle atlas. Previous segmentation methods use the maximum Euclidean distance between corresponding points of the subject fibers and the atlas centroids. However, this scheme might include noisy fibers. Here, we propose a three step approach to discard noisy fibers improving the identification of fibers. The first step applies a fiber clustering and the segmentation is performed between the centroids of the clusters and the atlas centroids. This step removes outliers and enables a better identification of fibers with similar shapes. The second step applies a fiber filter based on two different fiber similarities. One is the Symmetrized Segment-Path Distance (SSPD) over 2D ISOMAP and the other is an adapted version of SSPD for 3D space. The last step eliminates noisy fibers by removing those that connect regions that are far from the main atlas bundle connections. We perform an experimental evaluation using ten subjects of the Human Connectome (HCP) database. The evaluation only considers the bundles connecting precentral and postcentral gyri, with a total of seven bundles per hemisphere. For comparison, the bundles of the ten subjects were manually segmented. Bundles segmented with our method were evaluated in terms of similarity to manually segmented bundles and the final number of fibers. The results show that our approach obtains bundles with a higher similarity score than the state-of-the-art method and maintains a similar number of fibers.Clinical relevance—Many brain pathologies or disorders can occur in specific regions of the SWM automatic segmentation of reliable SWM bundles would help applications to clinical research.},

	abstract = {Background: MRI studies in patients with bipolar disorder have suggested that lithium is associated with grey matter increases that may underlie its therapeutic effects. However, the relationship between grey matter volume and cellular microstructural changes is not straightforward, as modifications of different cellular compartments of grey matter may be involved. Objectives: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that dendritic density is higher in patients undergoing lithium therapy than in patients without lithium, using advanced modelling of water diffusion investigated with MRI. Method: We included 41 patients and 40 controls matched for age and gender from two sites. All subjects underwent 3T MRI with 3 shells of diffusion. We used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging to compare the grey matter neurite density between patients undergoing lithium therapy or not and control subjects. Results: We found a significant group effect in the left prefrontal region (p = 0.001, Bonferroni corrected): patients without lithium had a lower frontal neurite density than controls (p = 0.009), while those on lithium had a higher mean neurite density than those without (p \&lt; 0.001). Patients on lithium were not different from controls (p = 0.08). Conclusions: This is the first study to report in vivo evidence of preserved neurite density of the prefrontal cortex in humans associated with lithium intake. Changes of intracellular volume fraction are thought to reflect changes of grey matter microstructural organization. This reinforces the hypothesis of lithium having a positive effect on the neuronal compartment in humans.},
