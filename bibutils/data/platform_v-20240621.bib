	abstract = {Cannabis use in adolescence may be characterized by differences in the neural basis of affective processing. In this study, we used an fMRI affective face processing task to compare a large group (n = 70) of 14-year olds with a history of cannabis use to a group (n = 70) of never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after excluding subjects with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence may place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a supervised multilayer factorization method designed for harmonic/percussive source separation and drum extraction. Our method decomposes the audio signals in sparse orthogonal components which capture the harmonic content, while the drum is represented by an extension of non negative matrix factorization which is able to exploit time-frequency dictionaries to take into account non stationary drum sounds. The drum dictionaries represent various real drum hits and the decomposition has more physical sense and allows for a better interpretation of the results. Experiments on real music data for a harmonic/percussive source separation task show that our method outperforms other state of the art algorithms. Finally, our method is very robust to non stationary harmonic sources that are usually poorly decomposed by existing methods.},

	abstract = {Dans cet article, nous proposons une méthode structurée de décomposition en matrices non-négatives visant a utiliser la structure multi-couche des signaux audio. Les signaux audio peuvent etre vus comme une superposition de deux couches : la couche tonale (modélisée par des sommes de sinuso¨des evoluant lentement en fréquence et en temps) et la couche transitoire (les sons percussifs, ´ ev enements de courtes durées etalés en fréquence). Notre méthode décompose une partie du signal en composantes orthogonales parcimonieuses, bien adaptées pour l'extraction tonale tandis que la partie transitoire est représentée par des bases de décomposition classiques. Les résultats de séparation de sources obtenus sur des signaux réels de musique ont montré que notre approche obtient des résultats similaires a ceux de l'´ etat de l'art. Abstract – In this paper, we propose a new unconstrained nonnegative matrix factorization method designed to utilize the multilayer structure of audio signals to improve the quality of the source separation. The tonal layer is sparse in frequency and temporally stable, while the transient layer is composed of short term broadband sounds. Our method has a part well suited for tonal extraction which decomposes the signals in sparse orthogonal components, while the transient part is represented by a regular nonnegative matrix factorization decomposition.

Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed that the five-factor model (with correlated errors added) had partial strong measurement invariance by countries. A total of 11 of the 25 items were non-invariant across samples. The level of internal consistency of the Total difficulties score was 0.84, ranging between 0.69 and 0.78 for the SDQ subscales. The findings indicate that the SDQ's subscales need to be modified in various ways for screening emotional and behavioural problems in the five European countries that were analysed.},

	abstract = {Objective: The authors examined whether alterations in the brain's reward network operate as a mechanism across the spectrum of risk for depression. They then tested whether these alterations are specific to anhedonia as compared with low mood and whether they are predictive of depressive outcomes. Method: Functional MRI was used to collect blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to anticipation of reward in the monetary incentive task in 1,576 adolescents in a community-based sample. Adolescents with current subthreshold depression and clinical depression were compared with matched healthy subjects. In addition, BOLD responses were compared across adolescents with anhedonia, low mood, or both symptoms, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: Activity in the ventral striatum was reduced in participants with subthreshold and clinical depression relative to healthy comparison subjects. Low ventral striatum activation predicted transition to subthreshold or clinical depression in previously healthy adolescents at 2-year follow-up. Brain responses during reward anticipation decreased in a graded manner between healthy adolescents, adolescents with current or future subthreshold depression, and adolescents with current or future clinical depression. Low ventral striatum activity was associated with anhedonia but not low mood; however, the combined presence of both symptoms showed the strongest reductions in the ventral striatum in all analyses. Conclusions: The findings suggest that reduced striatal activation operates as a mechanism across the risk spectrum for depression. It is associated with anhedonia in healthy adolescents and is a behavioral indicator of positive valence systems, consistent with predictions based on the Research Domain Criteria.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of brain tumors, but it may lead to severe cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown that ionizing irradiation induces demyelination, blood-brain barrier alterations, and impaired neurogenesis in animal models. Hence, noninvasive and sensitive biomarkers of irradiation injury are needed to investigate these effects in patients and improve radiation therapy protocols.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The heads of 3-month-old male C57BL/6RJ mice (15 control mice and 15 irradiated mice) were exposed to radiation doses of 3 fractions of 5 Gy from a 60Co source with a medical irradiator. A longitudinal study was performed to investigate cranial irradiation-induced (3 fractions of 5 Gy) microstructural tissue alterations using water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in different areas of the mouse brain (cortex, thalamus, striatum, olfactory bulbs [OBs], hippocampus, and subventricular zone [SVZ]). In addition to the quantification of standard non-Gaussian diffusion parameters, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC0) and kurtosis (K), we evaluated a new composite diffusion metric, designated the S-index (ie, "signature index").
RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in the S-index in the SVZ from 1 month to 8 months after brain irradiation (P {\textless} .05). An interesting finding was that, along with a decrease in taurine levels (up to -15\% at 2 months, P {\textless} .01), a delayed S-index drop was observed in the OBs from 4 months after irradiation and maintained until the end of our experiment (P {\textless} .0001). These observations suggest that S-index variations revealed the irradiation-induced decline of neurogenesis that was further confirmed by a decrease in neural stem cells in the SVZ and in newborn neurons in the OBs of irradiated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, especially through the S-index approach, is a relevant imaging modality to monitor brain irradiation injury and probe microstructural changes underlying irradiation-induced cognitive deficits.},

              Background
              Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) have been increasingly viewed as psychotic mood disorders along a shared spectrum. Long-range and short-range structural connectivity have been implicated in both disorders, conceptualising them as “disconnection syndromes”. There has been a rise in neuroimaging tools to understand the overlap and boundaries between the two disorders, which has shifted our focus towards appreciating traits in addition to diagnosis. Our recent pilot study examining short-range U-fibers found in superficial white matter (SWM) found shared and distinct traits among people with SZ and BD and we aimed to investigate SWM further using data from the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) consortium.
            
            
              Methods
              Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), we performed whole brain tractography in 113 people with SZ, 69 people with SA disorder, 49 people with psychotic BD and 77 healthy controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labelling of SWM tracts were performed using a comprehensive U-fiber atlas. ComBat was applied to remove site effects and principle components analysis was performed to identity networks of bundles used for comparative analyses.
            
            
              Results
              Principle component analysis revealed a network comprised of 8 short tracts in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions that had decreased anatomical connectivity in patients, regardless of diagnosis, relative to healthy controls. This network overlaps, in part, regions that differed between patients (SZ and BD) and healthy controls in our recent pilot study. However, we were unable to detect differences between people with SZ, SA disorder and psychotic BD.
            
            
              Discussion
              We demonstrate that short U-fibers are likely vulnerable to pathological processes in psychotic illnesses, encouraging further understanding of their anatomy and function. Our lack of findings between patient groups may reflect a more homogeneous population (three subgroups of psychosis) and may suggest that abnormalities in SWM are less likely due to mood disturbances.},

              Background
              Current demographic trends point towards an aging society entailing increasing occurrence and burden of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, understanding physiological aging and its turning point into neurodegeneration is essential for the development of possible biomarkers and future therapeutics of brain disease.
            
            
              Methods
              The SENIOR study represents a longitudinal, observational study including cognitively healthy elderlies aged between 50 and 70 years old at the time of inclusion, being followed annually over 10 years. Our multimodal protocol includes structural, diffusion, functional, and sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T and 7 T, positron emission tomography (PET), blood samples, genetics, audiometry, and neuropsychological and neurological examinations as well as assessment of neuronal risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              One hundred forty-two participants (50\% females) were enrolled in the SENIOR cohort with a mean age of 60 (SD 6.3) years at baseline. Baseline results with multiple regression analyses reveal that cerebral white matter lesions can be predicted by cardiovascular and cognitive risk factors and age. Cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with juxtacortical and periventricular lesions. Intra-subject across-test variability as a measure of neuropsychological test performance and possible cognitive marker predicts white matter volume and is significantly associated with risk profile. Division of the cohort into subjects with a higher and lower risk profile shows significant differences in intra-subject across-test variability and volumes as well as cortical thickness of brain regions of the temporal lobe. There is no difference between the lower- and higher-risk groups in amyloid load using PET data from a subset of 81 subjects.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated, multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We show that intra-subject across-test variability as a marker of neuropsychological test performance as well as age, gender, and combined risk factors influence neuronal decline as represented by decrease in brain volume, cortical thickness, and increase in white matter lesions. Baseline findings will be used as underlying basis for the further implications of aging and neuronal degeneration as well as examination of brain aging under different aspects of brain pathology versus physiological aging.},

	abstract = {Traditional supervised learning with deep neural networks requires a tremendous amount of labelled data to converge to a good solution. For 3D medical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated dataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to learn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural network. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by (almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks. Nonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such as participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage continuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by introducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve the positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with similar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar discriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for three classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's detection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on these tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is made publicly available here.},

	abstract = {Contrastive Learning has shown impressive results on natural and medical images, without requiring annotated data. However, a particularity of medical images is the availability of meta-data (such as age or sex) that can be exploited for learning representations. Here, we show that the recently proposed contrastive y-Aware InfoNCE loss, that integrates multi-dimensional meta-data, asymptotically optimizes two properties: conditional alignment and global uniformity. Similarly to [33], conditional alignment means that similar samples should have similar features, but conditionally on the meta-data. Instead, global uniformity means that the (normalized) features should be uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere, independently of the meta-data. Here, we propose to define conditional uniformity, relying on the meta-data, that repel only samples with dissimilar metadata. We show that direct optimization of both conditional alignment and uniformity improves the representations, in terms of linear evaluation, on both CIFAR-100 and a brain MRI dataset.},

To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e., proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both datasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA).

	abstract = {Subtype Discovery consists in finding interpretable and consistent sub-parts of a dataset, which are also relevant to a certain supervised task. From a mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9 points in terms of balanced accuracy. Finally, we make codes and examples available in a scikit-learn-compatible Python package at https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2021\_rlouiset\_ucsl},

	abstract = {Prediction of chronological age from neuroimaging in the healthy population is an important issue because the deviations from normal brain age may highlight abnormal trajectories towards brain disorders. As a first step, ML models have emerged to predict chronological age from brain MRI, as a proxy measure of biological age. However, there is currently no consensus w.r.t which Machine Learning (ML) model is best suited for this task, largely because of a lack of public benchmark. Furthermore, new large emerging population neuroimaging datasets are often biased by the acquisition center images are coming from. This bias heavily deteriorates models generalization capacities, especially for Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that are known to overfit rapidly on the simplest features (known as simplicity bias). Here we propose a new public benchmarking resource, namely Open Big Healthy Brains (OpenBHB), along with a challenge for both brain age prediction and site-effect removal through a representation learning framework. OpenBHB is large-scale, gathering {\textgreater}5K 3D T1 brain MRI from Healthy Controls (HC) and highly multi-sites, aggregating {\textgreater}60 centers worldwide and 10 studies. OpenBHB is expected to grow both in terms of available modalities and number of subjects. All OpenBHB datasets are uniformly preprocessed, including quality check, with container technologies that consist in: 3D Voxel-Based Morphometry maps (VBM from CAT12), quasi-raw (simple linear alignment of images), and Surface-Based Morphometry indices (SBM, from FreeSurfer). The OpenBHB challenge is permanent and we provide all tools, materials and tutorials for participants to easily submit and benchmark their model against each other on a public leaderboard.},

	abstract = {AIM: Neuroimaging-based machine-learning predictions of psychosis onset rely on the hypothesis that structural brain anomalies may reflect the underlying pathophysiology. Yet, current predictors remain difficult to interpret in light of brain structure. Here, we combined an advanced interpretable supervised algorithm and a model of neuroanatomical age to identify the level of brain maturation of the regions most predictive of psychosis.
METHODS: We used the voxel-based morphometry of a healthy control dataset (N = 2024) and a prospective longitudinal UHR cohort (N = 82), of which 27 developed psychosis after one year. In UHR, psychosis was predicted at one year using Elastic-Net-Total-Variation (Enet-TV) penalties within a five-fold cross-validation, providing an interpretable map of distinct predictive regions. Using both the whole brain and each predictive region separately, a brain age predictor was then built and validated in 1605 controls, externally tested in 419 controls from an independent cohort, and applied in UHR. Brain age gaps were computed as the difference between chronological and predicted age, providing a proxy of whole-brain and regional brain maturation.
RESULTS: Psychosis prediction was performant with 80 ± 4\% of area-under-curve and 69 ± 5\% of balanced accuracy (p {\textless} 0.001), and mainly leveraged volumetric increases in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and decreases in the left precentral gyrus and the right orbitofrontal cortex. These regions were predicted to have, respectively, delayed and accelerated maturational patterns.
CONCLUSION: By combining an interpretable supervised model of conversion to psychosis with a brain age predictor, we showed that inter-regional asynchronous brain maturation underlines the predictive signature of psychosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Brain development is of utmost importance for the emergence of psychiatric disorders, as the most severe of them arise before 25 years old. However, little is known regarding how early transdiagnostic symptoms, in a dimensional framework, are associated with cortical development. Anxiety and irritability are central vulnerability traits for subsequent mood and anxiety disorders. In this study, we investigate how these dimensions are related to structural changes in the brain to understand how they may increase the transition risk to full-blown disorders. Methods: We used the opportunity of an open access developmental cohort, the Healthy Brain Network, to investigate associations between cortical surface markers and irritability and anxiety scores as measured by parents and self-reports. Results: We found that in 658 young people (with a mean age of 11.6) the parental report of irritability is associated with decreased surface area in the bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. Furthermore, parental reports of anxiety were associated with decreased local gyrification index in the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results are consistent with current models of emotion regulation network maturation, showing decreased surface area or gyrification index in regions associated with impaired affective control in mood and anxiety disorders. Our results highlight how dimensional traits may increase vulnerability for these disorders.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal subfields, pivotal to episodic memory, are distinct both in terms of cyto- and myeloarchitectony. Studying the structure of hippocampal subfields in vivo is crucial to understand volumetric trajectories across the lifespan, from the emergence of episodic memory during early childhood to memory impairments found in older adults. However, segmenting hippocampal subfields on conventional MRI sequences is challenging because of their small size. Furthermore, there is to date no unified segmentation protocol for the hippocampal subfields, which limits comparisons between studies. Therefore, we introduced a novel segmentation tool called HSF short for hippocampal segmentation factory, which leverages an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. First, we validated HSF against currently used tools (ASHS, HIPS, and HippUnfold). Then, we used HSF on 3,750 subjects from the HCP development, young adults, and aging datasets to study the effect of age and sex on hippocampal subfields volumes. Firstly, we showed HSF to be closer to manual segmentation than other currently used tools (p {\textless} 0.001), regarding the Dice Coefficient, Hausdorff Distance, and Volumetric Similarity. Then, we showed differential maturation and aging across subfields, with the dentate gyrus being the most affected by age. We also found faster growth and decay in men than in women for most hippocampal subfields. Thus, while we introduced a new, fast and robust end-to-end segmentation tool, our neuroanatomical results concerning the lifespan trajectories of the hippocampal subfields reconcile previous conflicting results.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.
APPROACH: We released a public 3D Capsule Network (3D-AGSCaps, https://github.com/clementpoiret/3D-AGSCaps) and compared it to equivalent architectures using classical convolutions on the automatic segmentation of HSF on small and atypical datasets (incomplete hippocampal inversion, IHI). We tested 3D-AGSCaps on three datasets with manually labeled hippocampi.
RESULTS: Our main results were: (1) 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a better Dice Coefficient compared to CNNs on rotated hippocampi (p=0.004, cohen's d=0.179); (2) on typical subjects, 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a Dice coefficient similar to CNNs while having 15 times fewer parameters (2.285M versus 35.069M). This may greatly facilitate the study of atypical subjects, including healthy and pathological cases like those presenting an IHI.
CONCLUSION: We expect our newly introduced 3D-AGSCaps to allow a more accurate and fully automated segmentation on atypical populations, small datasets, as well as on and large cohorts where manual segmentations are nearly intractable.},

	abstract = {Each variation of the cortical folding pattern implies a particular rearrangement of the geometry of the fibers of the underlying white matter. While this rearrangement only impacts the ends of the long pathways, it may affect most of the trajectory of the short bundles. Therefore, mapping the short fibers of the human brain using diffusion-based tractography requires a dedicated strategy to overcome the variability of the folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a fiber-based stratification strategy splitting the population into homogeneous groups for disentangling the superficial white matter bundle organization. This strategy introduces a new refined fiber distance which includes angular considerations for inferring fine-grained atlases of the short bundles surrounding a specific sulcus and a subtractogram distance that quantifies the similitude between fiber sets of two different subjects. The stratification splits the population into groups with similar regional fiber organization using manifold learning. We first successfully test the hypothesis that the main source of variability of the regional fiber organization is the variability of the regional folding pattern. Then, in each group, we proceed with the automatic identification of the most stable bundles, at a higher granularity level than what can be achieved with the non-stratified whole population, enabling the disentanglement of the very variable configuration of the short fibers. Finally, the method searches for bundle correspondence across groups to build a population level atlas. As a proof of concept, the atlas refinement achieved by this strategy is illustrated for the fibers that surround the central sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus using the HCP dataset.},

One such initiative is the Neuromark, a fully automated spatially constrained independent component analysis (ICA) that is used to link brain network abnormalities among different datasets, studies, and disorders while leveraging subject-specific networks. In this study, we implement the neuromark pipeline in COINSTAC, an open-source neuroimaging framework for collaborative/decentralized analysis. Decentralized exploratory analysis of nearly 2000 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets collected at different sites across two cohorts and co-located in different countries was performed to study the resting brain functional network connectivity changes in adolescents who smoke and consume alcohol. Results showed hypoconnectivity across the majority of networks including sensory, default mode, and subcortical domains, more for alcohol than smoking, and decreased low frequency power. These findings suggest that global reduced synchronization is associated with both tobacco and alcohol use. This proof-of-concept work demonstrates the utility and incentives associated with large-scale decentralized collaborations spanning multiple sites.},

However, its neurobiological mechanisms and generalizability remain elusive. In this study, we used a large longitudinal neuroimaging cohort from adolescence to young adulthood (IMAGEN) to define a neuropsychopathological (NP) factor across externalizing and internalizing symptoms using multitask connectomes. We demonstrate that this NP factor might represent a unified, genetically determined, delayed development of the prefrontal cortex that further leads to poor executive function. We also show this NP factor to be reproducible in multiple developmental periods, from preadolescence to early adulthood, and generalizable to the resting-state connectome and clinical samples (the ADHD-200 Sample and the STRATIFY \& ESTRA Project). In conclusion, we identify a reproducible and general neural basis underlying symptoms of multiple mental health disorders, bridging multidimensional evidence from behavioral, neuroimaging and genetic substrates.

Data were obtained from the IMAGEN study conducted across eight European sites. We identified IMAGEN participants who reported being cannabis-naïve at baseline and had data available at baseline, 5-year, and 9-year follow-up visits. Cannabis use was assessed with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs. T1-weighted MR images were processed through the CIVET pipeline. Cannabis initiation occurring during adolescence (14–19 years) and young adulthood (19–22 years) was associated with differing patterns of longitudinal cortical thickness change. Associations between adolescent cannabis initiation and cortical thickness change were observed primarily in dorso- and ventrolateral portions of the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, cannabis initiation occurring between 19 and 22 years of age was associated with thickness change in temporal and cortical midline areas. Follow-up analysis revealed that longitudinal brain change related to adolescent initiation persisted into young adulthood and partially mediated the association between adolescent cannabis use and past-month cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis use at age 22. Extent of cannabis initiation during young adulthood (from 19 to 22 years) had an indirect effect on psychotic symptoms at age 22 through thickness change in temporal areas. Results suggest that developmental timing of cannabis exposure may have a marked effect on neuroanatomical correlates of cannabis use as well as associated behavioral sequelae. Critically, this work provides a foundation for neurodevelopmentally informed models of cannabis exposure in humans.},

We reported both the associations between sulcal polymorphisms as well with a wide range of demographics (e.g. age, sex, handedness). Finally, we also estimated the heritability, and the genetic correlation between sulcal connections. We reported the frequency of the sulcal connections in the general population, which were hemisphere dependent. We found a sexual dimorphism of the connections, especially marked in the right hemisphere, with a CS-OTS connection more frequent in females (approximately 35–40\% versus 20–25\% in males) and an RS-CS connection more common in males (approximately 40–45\% versus 25–30\% in females). We confirmed associations between sulcal connections and characteristics of incomplete hippocampal inversion (IHI). We estimated the broad sense heritability to be 0.28–0.45 for RS-CS and CS-OTS connections, with hints of dominant contribution for the RS-CS connection. The connections appeared to share some of their genetic causing factors as indicated by strong genetic correlations. Heritability appeared much smaller for the (rarer) RS-OTS connection.},

	abstract = {Previous research has suggested an association between living environment during the first 15 years of life and brain structure. More precisely, urbanicity during upbringing has been shown to be negatively related to prefrontal cortex grey matter. The present study focusses instead on the current living environment of 677 younger adults recruited from different cities across Europe. We observed a positive association between amount of tree cover density, in a radius of 500m around the current home address and grey matter volume in right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC). Of note, the volume of the rOFC cluster identified, showed a positive association with cognitive performance in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, namely in the verbal and spatial ability domain (Vocabulary, Block Design), and a negative association with both, self-reported and behavioural markers of impulsivity (delay discounting). Moreover, rOFC volume showed a negative association with self-reported alcohol use problems. The data provide strong evidence in favour of a link between geographical features of the current living environment (particularly trees) and brain structure above and beyond childhood and upbringing. Interestingly, the respective brain correlates are associated with cognitive, behavioural and personality characteristics which have been considered as risk factors for several psychiatric disorders. Environmental neuroscience may in the long run provide a knowledge base for evidence-based urban landscape planning to facilitate mental health.},

	abstract = {Background Stress exposure in childhood and adolescence has been linked to reductions in cortical structures and cognitive functioning. However, to date, most of these studies have been cross-sectional, limiting the ability to make long-term inferences, given that most cortical structures continue to develop through adolescence. Methods Here, we used a subset of the IMAGEN population cohort sample (N = 502; assessment ages: 14, 19, and 22 years; mean age: 21.945 years; SD = 0.610) to understand longitudinally the long-term interrelations between stress, cortical development, and cognitive functioning. To these ends, we first used a latent change score model to examine four bivariate relations – assessing individual differences in change in the relations between adolescent stress exposure and volume, surface area, and cortical thickness of cortical structures, as well as cognitive outcomes. Second, we probed for indirect neurocognitive effects linking stress to cortical brain structures and cognitive functions using rich longitudinal mediation modeling. Results Latent change score modeling showed that greater baseline adolescence stress at age 14 predicted a small reduction in the right anterior cingulate volume (Std. β = −.327, p = .042, 95\% CI [−0.643, −0.012]) and right anterior cingulate surface area (Std. β = −.274, p = .038, 95\% CI [−0.533, −0.015]) across ages 14–22. These effects were very modest in nature and became nonsignificant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Our longitudinal analyses found no evidence of indirect effects in the two neurocognitive pathways linking adolescent stress to brain and cognitive outcomes. Conclusion Findings shed light on the impact of stress on brain reductions, particularly in the prefrontal cortex that have consistently been implicated in the previous cross-sectional studies. However, the magnitude of effects observed in our study is smaller than that has been reported in past cross-sectional work. This suggests that the potential impact of stress during adolescence on brain structures may likely be more modest than previously noted.},

However, the neural mechanisms underlying smoking initiation and sustenance during adolescence, especially the potential causal interactions between altered brain development and smoking behaviour, remain elusive. Here, using large longitudinal adolescence imaging genetic cohorts, we identify associations between left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) gray matter volume (GMV) and subsequent self-reported smoking initiation, and between right vmPFC GMV and the maintenance of smoking behaviour. Rule-breaking behaviour mediates the association between smaller left vmPFC GMV and smoking behaviour based on longitudinal cross-lagged analysis and Mendelian randomisation. In contrast, smoking behaviour associated longitudinal covariation of right vmPFC GMV and sensation seeking (especially hedonic experience) highlights a potential reward-based mechanism for sustaining addictive behaviour. Taken together, our findings reveal vmPFC GMV as a possible biomarker for the early stages of nicotine addiction, with implications for its prevention and treatment.},

Our study seeks to examine the relationship between autistic traits and alcohol use in a large adolescent population. Leveraging data from the IMAGEN cohort, including 2045 14-year-old adolescents that were followed-up to age 18, we selected items on social preference/skills and rigidity from different questionnaires. We used linear regression models to (1) test the effect of the sum scores on the prevalence of alcohol use (AUDIT-C) over time, (2) explore the relationship between autistic traits and alcohol use patterns, and (3) explore the specific effect of each autistic trait on alcohol use. Higher scores on the selected items were associated with trajectories of less alcohol use from the ages between 14 and 18 (b = − 0.030; CI 95\% = − 0.042, − 0.017; p {\textless} 0.001). Among adolescents who used alcohol, those who reported more autistic traits were also drinking less per occasion than their peers and were less likely to engage in binge drinking. We found significant associations between alcohol use and social preference (p {\textless} 0.001), nervousness for new situations (p = 0.001), and detail orientation (p {\textless} 0.001). Autistic traits (social impairment, detail orientation, and anxiety) may buffer against alcohol use in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Exposure to preadult environmental exposures may have long-lasting effects on mental health by affecting the maturation of the brain and personality, two traits that interact throughout the developmental process. However, environment-brain-personality covariation patterns and their mediation relationships remain unclear. In 4297 healthy participants (aged 18–30 years), we combined sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis with independent component analysis to identify the three-way covariation patterns of 59 preadult environmental exposures, 760 adult brain imaging phenotypes, and five personality traits, and found two robust environment-brain-personality covariation models with sex specificity. One model linked greater stress and less support to weaker functional connectivity and activity in the default mode network, stronger activity in subcortical nuclei, greater thickness and volume in the occipital, parietal and temporal cortices, and lower agreeableness, consciousness and extraversion as well as higher neuroticism. The other model linked higher urbanicity and better socioeconomic status to stronger functional connectivity and activity in the sensorimotor network, smaller volume and surface area and weaker functional connectivity and activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, lower white matter integrity, and higher openness to experience. We also conducted mediation analyses to explore the potential bidirectional mediation relationships between adult brain imaging phenotypes and personality traits with the influence of preadult environmental exposures and found both environment-brain-personality and environment-personality-brain pathways. We finally performed moderated mediation analyses to test the potential interactions between macro- and microenvironmental exposures and found that one category of exposure moderated the mediation pathways of another category of exposure. These results improve our understanding of the effects of preadult environmental exposures on the adult brain and personality traits and may facilitate the design of targeted interventions to improve mental health by reducing the impact of adverse environmental exposures.},

	abstract = {A growing number of evidence supports a continued distribution of autistic traits in the general population. However, brain maturation trajectories of autistic traits as well as the influence of sex on these trajectories remain largely unknown. We investigated the association of autistic traits in the general population, with longitudinal gray matter (GM) maturation trajectories during the critical period of adolescence. We assessed 709 community-based adolescents (54.7\% women) at age 14 and 22. After testing the effect of sex, we used whole-brain voxel-based morphometry to measure longitudinal GM volumes changes associated with autistic traits measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total and sub-scores. In women, we observed that the SRS was associated with slower GM volume decrease globally and in the left parahippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. The social communication sub-score correlated with slower GM volume decrease in the left parahippocampal, superior temporal gyrus, and pallidum; and the social cognition sub-score correlated with slower GM volume decrease in the left middle temporal gyrus, the right ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. No longitudinal association was found in men. Autistic traits in young women were found to be associated with specific brain trajectories in regions of the social brain and the reward circuit known to be involved in Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings support both the hypothesis of an earlier GM maturation associated with autistic traits in adolescence and of protective mechanisms in women. They advocate for further studies on brain trajectories associated with autistic traits in women.},

Here we aggregated genetic and neuroimaging data from 61,974 participants (age range, 9 to 98 years) in five cohorts to elucidate the genetic basis of ventricular morphology and examined their overlap with neuropsychiatric traits. Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology. We replicated over 80\% of loci in a well-matched cohort of lateral ventricular volume. Gene set analysis revealed enrichment of ventricular-trait-associated genes in biological processes and disease pathogenesis during both early brain development and degeneration. We explored the age-dependent genetic associations in cohorts of different age groups to investigate the possible roles of ventricular-trait-associated loci in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. We describe the genetic overlap between ventricular and neuropsychiatric traits through comprehensive integrative approaches under correlative and causal assumptions. We propose the volume of the inferior lateral ventricles as a heritable endophenotype to predict the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, which might be a consequence of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Our study provides an advance in understanding the genetics of the cerebral ventricles and demonstrates the potential utility of ventricular measurements in tracking brain disorders and maintaining brain health across the lifespan.},

Repeated COVID-19 surveys and standardised mental health assessments were used to compare trajectories of mental health symptoms from before the pandemic through to the second lockdown.ResultsMental health trajectories differed significantly between cohorts. In the population cohort, depression and eating disorder symptoms increased by 33.9\% (95\% CI 31.78–36.57) and 15.6\% (95\% CI 15.39–15.68) during the pandemic, respectively. By contrast, these remained high over time in the clinical cohort. Conversely, trajectories of alcohol misuse were similar in both cohorts, decreasing continuously (a 15.2\% decrease) during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic symptom severity predicted the observed mental health trajectories in the population cohort. Surprisingly, being relatively healthy predicted increases in depression and eating disorder symptoms and in body mass index. By contrast, those initially at higher risk for depression or eating disorders reported a lasting decrease.ConclusionsHealthier young people may be at greater risk of developing depressive or eating disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted mental health interventions considering prior diagnostic risk may be warranted to help young people cope with the challenges of psychosocial stress and reduce the associated healthcare burden.},

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the subcortical structural trajectories and their sex differences across adolescence using for the first time a single cohort design, the same quality control procedure, software, and a general additive mixed modeling approach. We investigated two large European sites from ages 14 to 24 with 503 participants and 1408 total scans from France and Germany as part of the IMAGEN project including four waves of data acquisition. We found significantly larger volumes in males versus females in both sites and across all seven subcortical regions. Sex differences in age-related trajectories were observed across all regions in both sites. Our findings provide further evidence of sex differences in longitudinal adolescent brain development of subcortical regions and thus might eventually support the relationship of underlying brain development and different adolescent psychopathology in boys and girls.},

	abstract = {During late adolescence, the brain undergoes ontogenic organization altering subcortical-cortical circuitry. This includes regions implicated in pain chronicity, and thus alterations in the adolescent ontogenic organization could predispose to pain chronicity in adulthood - however, evidence is lacking. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from a large European longitudinal adolescent cohort and an adult cohort with and without chronic pain, we examined links between painful symptoms and brain connectivity. During late adolescence, thalamo-, caudate-, and red nucleus-cortical connectivity were positively and subthalamo-cortical connectivity negatively associated with painful symptoms. Thalamo-cortical connectivity, but also subthalamo-cortical connectivity, was increased in adults with chronic pain compared to healthy controls. Our results indicate a shared basis in basothalamo-cortical circuitries between adolescent painful symptomatology and adult pain chronicity, with the subthalamic pathway being differentially involved, potentially due to a hyperconnected thalamo-cortical pathway in chronic pain and ontogeny-driven organization. This can inform neuromodulation-based prevention and early intervention.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a crucial period for physical and psychological development. The impact of negative life events represents a risk factor for the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. This study aims to investigate the relationship between negative life events and structural brain connectivity, considering both graph theory and connectivity strength. A group (n = 487) of adolescents from the IMAGEN Consortium was divided into Low and High Stress groups. Brain networks were extracted at an individual level, based on morphological similarity between grey matter regions with regions defined using an atlas-based region of interest (ROI) approach. Between-group comparisons were performed with global and local graph theory measures in a range of sparsity levels. The analysis was also performed in a larger sample of adolescents (n = 976) to examine linear correlations between stress level and network measures. Connectivity strength differences were investigated with network-based statistics. Negative life events were not found to be a factor influencing global network measures at any sparsity level. At local network level, between-group differences were found in centrality measures of the left somato-motor network (a decrease of betweenness centrality was seen at sparsity 5\%), of the bilateral central visual and the left dorsal attention network (increase of degree at sparsity 10\% at sparsity 30\% respectively). Network-based statistics analysis showed an increase in connectivity strength in the High stress group in edges connecting the dorsal attention, limbic and salience networks. This study suggests negative life events alone do not alter structural connectivity globally, but they are associated to connectivity properties in areas involved in emotion and attention.},

	abstract = {The asymmetry of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has been identified as a species-specific feature of the human brain. The so-called superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP) area is observed from the last trimester of gestation onwards and is far less pronounced in the chimpanzee brain. This asymmetry is associated with more frequent sulcal interruptions, named plis de passage (PPs), leading to the irregular morphology of the left sulcus. In this paper, we aimed to characterize the variability, asymmetry, and heritability of these interruptions in the STS in comparison with the other main sulci. We developed an automated method to extract PPs across the cortex based on a highly reproducible grid of sulcal pits across individuals, which we applied to a subset of Human Connectome Project (HCP) subjects (N = 820). We report that only a few PPs across the cortex are genetically constrained, namely in the collateral, postcentral and superior temporal sulci and the calcarine fissure. Moreover, some PPs occur more often in one hemisphere than the other, namely in the precentral, postcentral, intraparietal sulci, as well as in both inferior and superior temporal sulci. Most importantly, we found that only the interruptions within the STAP region are both asymmetric and genetically constrained. Because this morphological pattern is located in an area of the left hemisphere related to speech, our results suggest structural constraints on the architecture of the linguistic network.},

However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from postmortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labeling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory, and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function.},

However, the prospective association between WM integrity and frailty is still unclear. Our objectives were to measure associations between WM integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the 5-year worsening of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). SETTING Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS Participants (mean age = 74.7 ± 3.9 years) with no dementia at baseline who had functional magnetic resonance imaging performed as part of the MAPT study (n = 227). MEASUREMENTS Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were acquired for 10 different brain regions. Frailty was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype (score from 0 to 5, higher is worse) at up to seven time points for 5 years. Mixed effect ordinal logistic regression model was used to assess the prospective association between DTI parameters (independent variables) and frailty (dependent variable). All the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline total intracranial volume, and the presence of one of the following cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and/or hypercholesterolemia). RESULTS A statistically significant association was found between the RD, AxD, and MD for different brain regions (anterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, superior frontal occipital fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) and worsening of frailty over 5 years after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to show that WM integrity is associated with frailty in older adults. The mechanisms related to these results require further investigation.

Here we conducted multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using hypothalamic imaging data from 32,956 individuals to uncover the genetic underpinnings of the hypothalamus and its involvement in neuropsychiatric traits. There were 23 significant loci associated with the whole hypothalamus and its subunits, with functional enrichment for genes involved in intracellular trafficking systems and metabolic processes of steroid-related compounds. The hypothalamus exhibited substantial genetic associations with limbic system structures and neuropsychiatric traits including chronotype, risky behaviour, cognition, satiety and sympathetic–parasympathetic activity. The strongest signal in the primary GWAS, the ADAMTS8 locus, was replicated in three independent datasets (N = 1,685–4,321) and was strengthened after meta-analysis. Exome-wide association analyses added evidence to the association for ADAMTS8, and Mendelian randomization showed lower ADAMTS8 expression with larger hypothalamic volumes. The current study advances our understanding of complex structure–function relationships of the hypothalamus and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie hypothalamic formation.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of puberty and sex on the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of brain networks, with a focus on the default-mode network (DMN). Consistently implicated in depressive disorders, the DMN’s function may interact with puberty and sex in the development of these disorders, whose onsets peak in adolescence, and which show strong sex disproportionality (females {\textgreater} males). The main question concerns how the DMN evolves with puberty as a function of sex. These effects are expected to involve within- and between-network iFC, particularly, the salience and the central-executive networks, consistent with the Triple-Network Model. Resting-state scans of an adolescent community sample (n = 304, male/female: 157/147; mean/std age: 14.6/0.41 years), from the IMAGEN database, were analyzed using the AFNI software suite and a data reduction strategy for the effects of puberty and sex. Three midline regions (medial prefrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate), within the DMN and consistently implicated in mood disorders, were selected as seeds. Within- and between-network clusters of the DMN iFC changed with pubertal maturation differently in boys and girls (puberty-X-sex). Specifically, pubertal maturation predicted weaker iFC in girls and stronger iFC in boys. Finally, iFC was stronger in boys than girls independently of puberty. Brain–behavior associations indicated that lower connectivity of the anterior cingulate seed predicted higher internalizing symptoms at 2-year follow-up. In conclusion, weaker iFC of the anterior DMN may signal disconnections among circuits supporting mood regulation, conferring risk for internalizing disorders.},

	abstract = {In structural neuroimaging studies, reduced cerebral cortical thickness in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions is frequently interpreted as reflecting an impaired ability to downregulate neuronal activity in the amygdalae. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted in order to test this conjecture. We examine the extent to which amygdalar reactivity is associated with cortical thickness in a population-based sample of adolescents. Data were obtained from the IMAGEN study, which includes 2,223 adolescents. While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants passively viewed video clips of a face that started from a neutral expression and progressively turned angry, or, instead, turned to a second neutral expression. Left and right amygdala ROIs were used to extract mean BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast for all subjects. T1-weighted images were processed through the CIVET pipeline (version 2.1.0). In variable-centered analyses, local cortical thickness was regressed against amygdalar reactivity using first and second-order linear models. In a follow-up person-centered analysis, we defined a “high reactive” group of participants based on mean amygdalar BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast. Between-group differences in cortical thickness were examined (“high reactive” versus all other participants). A significant association was revealed between the continuous measure of amygdalar reactivity and bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortical thickness in a second-order linear model (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected). The “high reactive” group, in comparison to all other participants, possessed reduced cortical thickness in bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, bilateral anterior temporal cortices, left caudal middle temporal gyrus, and the left inferior and middle frontal gyri (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected). Results are consistent with non-human primate studies, and provide empirical support for an association between reduced prefrontal cortical thickness and amygdalar reactivity. Future research will likely benefit from investigating the degree to which psychopathology qualifies relations between prefrontal cortical structure and amygdalar reactivity.},

The IMAGEN dataset was utilized to investigate predictors for problematic alcohol consumption at age 18–20 years as a function self and parental personality and drug-related measures as well as life-events and cognitive variables all assessed at age 14 years (N = 1404). For this purpose the binary partitioning algorithm ctree was used in an explorative analysis. The algorithm recursively selects significant input variables and splits the outcome variable based on these, yielding a conditional inference tree. Four significant split variables, namely Place of residence, the Disorganization subscale of the Temperament and Character Inventory, Sex, and the Sexuality subscale of the life-events questionnaire were found to distinguish between adolescents scoring high or low on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test about five years later (all p {\textless} 0.001). The analyis adds to the literature on predictors of adolescent drinking problems using a large European sample. The identified split variables could easily be collected in community samples. If their validity is proven in independent samples, they could facilitate intervention studies in the field of adolescent alcohol prevention.},

	abstract = {Contemporary theories propose that dysregulation of emotional perception is involved in the aetiology of psychosis. 298 healthy adolescents were assessed at age 14- and 19-years using fMRI while performing a facial emotion task. Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) were assessed with the CAPE-42 questionnaire at age 19. The high PLEs group at age 19 years exhibited an enhanced response in right insular cortex and decreased response in right prefrontal, right parahippocampal and left striatal regions; also, a gradient of decreasing response to emotional faces with age, from 14 to 19 years, in the right parahippocampal region and left insular cortical area. The right insula demonstrated an increasing response to emotional faces with increasing age in the low PLEs group, and a decreasing response over time in the high PLEs group. The change in parahippocampal/amygdala and insula responses during the perception of emotional faces in adolescents with high PLEs between the ages of 14 and 19 suggests a potential ‘aberrant’ neurodevelopmental trajectory for critical limbic areas. Our findings emphasize the role of the frontal and limbic areas in the aetiology of psychotic symptoms, in subjects without the illness phenotype and the confounds introduced by antipsychotic medication.},

It is unclear to what extent the deficit in each of these processes contributes to individual behavioural symptoms, how their neural substrates give rise to distinct behavioural outcomes and whether neural activation profiles across different reinforcement-related processes might differentiate individual behaviours. We created a statistical framework that enabled us to directly compare functional brain activation during reward anticipation, motor inhibition and viewing emotional faces in the European IMAGEN cohort of 2,000 14-year-old adolescents. We observe significant correlations and modulation of reward anticipation and motor inhibition networks in hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattentive behaviour and conduct symptoms, and we describe neural signatures across cognitive tasks that differentiate these behaviours. We thus characterise shared and distinct functional brain activation patterns underling different externalising symptoms and identify neural stratification markers, while accounting for clinically observed comorbidity.},

	abstract = {Replicating results (i.e. obtaining consistent results using a new independent dataset) is an essential part of good science. As replicability has consequences for theories derived from empirical studies, it is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing it. A popular tool for non-invasive neuroimaging studies is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the effect of underpowered studies is well documented, the empirical assessment of the interplay between sample size and replicability of results for task-based fMRI studies remains limited. In this work, we extend existing work on this assessment in two ways. Firstly, we use a large database of 1400 subjects performing four types of tasks from the IMAGEN project to subsample a series of independent samples of increasing size. Secondly, replicability is evaluated using a multi-dimensional framework consisting of 3 different measures: (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability. We demonstrate not only a positive effect of sample size, but also a trade-off between spatial resolution and replicability. When replicability is assessed voxelwise or when observing small areas of activation, a larger sample size than typically used in fMRI is required to replicate results. On the other hand, when focussing on clusters of voxels, we observe a higher replicability. In addition, we observe variability in the size of clusters of activation between experimental paradigms or contrasts of parameter estimates within these.},

To investigate the association between rural vs. urban upbringing and brain structure we selected 106 14-year old adolescents of whom half were exclusively raised in rural areas and the other half who exclusively lived in cities. Voxel-based morphometry revealed a group difference in left hippocampal formation (Rural {\textgreater} City), which was positively associated with cognitive performance in a spatial processing task. Moreover, significant group differences were observed in spatial processing (Rural {\textgreater} City). A mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal formation accounted for more than half of the association between upbringing and spatial processing. The results are compatible with studies reporting earlier and more intense opportunities for spatial exploration in children brought up in rural areas. The results are interesting in the light of urban planning where spaces enabling spatial exploration for children may deserve more attention.},

	abstract = {Eating disorders are serious mental disorders with increasing prevalence. Without early identification and treatment, eating disorders may run a long-term course.To characterize any associations among disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) and other mental health disorders and to identify early associations with the development of symptoms over time.This multicenter, population-based, longitudinal cohort study used data from baseline (collected in 2010), follow-up 1 (collected in 2012), and follow-up 2 (collected in 2015) of the IMAGEN Study, which included adolescents recruited from 8 European sites. The present study assessed data from 1623 healthy adolescents, aged 14 years at baseline, recruited from high schools. Data analyses were performed from January 2018 to September 2019.Body mass index (BMI), mental health symptoms, substance use behaviors, and personality variables were investigated as time-varying associations of DEBs (dieting, binge eating, and purging) or change in BMI over time. Polygenic risk scores were calculated to investigate genetic contributions associated with BMI, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neuroticism to DEBs.In this cohort study of 1623 adolescents (829 girls [51.1\%]) recruited at a mean (SD) age of 14.5 (0.4) years and followed up at ages 16 and 19 years, 278 adolescents (17.1\%) reported binge eating, 334 adolescents (20.6\%) reported purging, and 356 adolescents (21.9\%) reported dieting at 14, 16, or 19 years. Among the precursors of DEBs, high BMI was associated with future dieting (OR, 3.44; 95\% CI, 2.09-5.65). High levels of neuroticism (OR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.06), conduct problems (OR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.69), and deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.37-3.45) were associated with future binge eating. Low agreeableness (OR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.92-0.97), deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.59; 95\% CI, 1.69-3.95), conduct problems (OR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.68), alcohol misuse (OR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.54), and drug abuse (OR, 2.91; 95\% CI, 1.78-4.74) were associated with future purging. Polygenetic risk scores for BMI were associated with dieting (at 14 years: OR, 1.27; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.08; at 16 years: OR, 1.38; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.17); ADHD, with purging (at 16 years: OR, 1.25; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.08; at 19 years, OR, 1.23; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.06); and neuroticism, with binge eating (at 14 years: OR, 1.32; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.11; at 16 years: OR, 1.24; lower bound 95\% CI, 1.06), highlighting distinct etiologic overlaps between these traits. The DEBs predated other mental health problems, with dieting at 14 years associated with future symptoms of depression (OR, 2.53; 95\% CI, 1.56-4.10), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.27; 95\% CI, 1.14-4.51), deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.51-4.24), emotional problems (OR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.43), and smoking (OR, 2.16; 95\% CI, 1.36-3.48). Purging at 14 years was also associated with future depression (OR, 2.87; 95\% CI, 1.69-5.01) and anxiety (OR, 2.48; 95\% CI, 1.49-4.12) symptoms.The findings of this study delineate temporal associations and shared etiologies among DEBs and other mental health disorders and emphasize the potential of genetic and phenotypical assessments of obesity, behavioral disorders, and neuroticism to improve early and differential diagnosis of eating disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess changes in cannabis use in young adults as a function of psychotic-like experiences.
Method
Participants were initially recruited at age 14 in high schools for the longitudinal IMAGEN study. All measures presented here were assessed at follow-ups at age 19 and at age 22, respectively. Perceived stress was only assessed once at age 22. Ever users of cannabis (N = 552) gave qualitative and quantitative information on cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). Of those, nearly all n = 549 reported to have experienced at least one psychotic experience of any form at age 19.
Results
Mean cannabis use increased from age 19 to 22 and age of first use of cannabis was positively associated with a change in cannabis use between the two time points. Change in cannabis use was not significantly associated with psychotic-like experiences at age 19 or 22. In exploratory analysis, we observed a positive association between perceived stress and the experience of psychotic experiences at age 22.
Conclusion
Age of first use of cannabis influenced trajectories of young cannabis users with later onset leading to higher increase, whereas the frequency of psychotic-like experiences was not associated with a change in cannabis use. The observed association between perceived stress and psychotic-like experiences at age 22 emphasizes the importance of stress experiences in developing psychosis independent of cannabis use.},

	abstract = {Background
The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in depression. The hypothesis investigated was whether the OFC sensitivity to reward and nonreward is related to the severity of depressive symptoms.
Methods
Activations in the monetary incentive delay task were measured in the IMAGEN cohort at ages 14 years (n = 1877) and 19 years (n = 1140) with a longitudinal design. Clinically relevant subgroups were compared at ages 19 (high-severity group: n = 116; low-severity group: n = 206) and 14.
Results
The medial OFC exhibited graded activation increases to reward, and the lateral OFC had graded activation increases to nonreward. In this general population, the medial and lateral OFC activations were associated with concurrent depressive symptoms at both ages 14 and 19 years. In a stratified high-severity depressive symptom group versus control group comparison, the lateral OFC showed greater sensitivity for the magnitudes of activations related to nonreward in the high-severity group at age 19 (p = .027), and the medial OFC showed decreased sensitivity to the reward magnitudes in the high-severity group at both ages 14 (p = .002) and 19 (p = .002). In a longitudinal design, there was greater sensitivity to nonreward of the lateral OFC at age 14 for those who exhibited high depressive symptom severity later at age 19 (p = .003).
Conclusions
Activations in the lateral OFC relate to sensitivity to not winning, were associated with high depressive symptom scores, and at age 14 predicted the depressive symptoms at ages 16 and 19. Activations in the medial OFC were related to sensitivity to winning, and reduced reward sensitivity was associated with concurrent high depressive symptom scores.},

	abstract = {Conduct problems (CP) in patients with disruptive behavior disorders have been linked to impaired prefrontal processing of negative facial affect compared to controls. However, it is unknown whether associations with prefrontal activity during affective face processing hold along the CP dimension in a healthy population sample, and how subcortical processing is affected. We measured functional brain responses during negative affective face processing in 1444 healthy adolescents [M = 14.39 years (SD = 0.40), 51.5\% female] from the European IMAGEN multicenter study. To determine the effects of CP, we applied a two-step approach: (a) testing matched subgroups of low versus high CP, extending into the clinical range [N = 182 per group, M = 14.44 years, (SD = 0.41), 47.3\% female] using analysis of variance, and (b) considering (non)linear effects along the CP dimension in the full sample and in the high CP group using multiple regression. We observed no significant cortical or subcortical effect of CP group on brain responses to negative facial affect. In the full sample, regression analyses revealed a significant linear increase of left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity with increasing CP up to the clinical range. In the high CP group, a significant inverted u-shaped effect indicated that left OFC responses decreased again in individuals with high CP. Left OFC activity during negative affective processing which is increasing with CP and decreasing in the highest CP range may reflect on the importance of frontal control mechanisms that counteract the consequences of severe CP by facilitating higher social engagement and better evaluation of social content in adolescents.},

Identifying reliable predictive biomarkers that place the adolescents at elevated risk for future IC deficits can help guide early interventions, yet the scarcity of longitudinal research has hindered the progress. Here, using a large-scale longitudinal dataset in which the same subjects performed a stop signal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at ages 14 and 19, we tracked their IC development individually and tried to find the brain features predicting their development by constructing prediction models using 14-year-olds’ functional connections within a network or between a pair of networks. The participants had distinct between-subject trajectories in their IC development. Of the candidate connections used for prediction, ventral attention-subcortical network interconnections could predict the individual development of IC and formed a prediction model that generalized to previously unseen individuals. Furthermore, we found that connectivity between these two networks was related to substance abuse problems, an IC-deficit related problematic behavior, within 5 years. Our study reveals individual differences in IC development from mid- to late-adolescence and highlights the importance of ventral attention-subcortical network interconnections in predicting future IC development and substance abuse in adolescents.},

	abstract = {Non-acute effects of cannabis on neurocognition in adolescents remain unclear with most studies being cross-sectional. Therefore, the aim of this longitudinal, multi-center study was to examine the effects of cannabis use on cognitive abilities in participants emerging into adulthood. Data on substance use as well as neurocognitive measures were assessed in 804 adolescents (441 females, 363 males) at age 14 and 19. First, cross-sectional analyses of baseline and follow-up data were conducted using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). Second, repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted to quantify longitudinal change. Cross-sectionally, we detected no significant neurocognitive differences before initiation of drug use. However, after controlling for confounders, light cannabis use as well as late-onset thereof was associated with increased decision-making skills both cross-sectionally at follow-up as well as longitudinally compared to non-using controls. In summary, our data suggests that decision-making is not impaired when cannabis is used in moderation and onset of use occurs after the age of 15. In addition, we find no evidence to support the presumption that cannabis consumption leads to a decline in neurocognitive ability.},

We sought to discover linked patterns of covariation between brain structural development and a wide array of these factors by leveraging data from the IMAGEN study, a longitudinal population-based cohort of adolescents. Brain structural measures and a comprehensive array of non-imaging features (relating to demographic, anthropometric, and psychosocial characteristics) were available on 1476 IMAGEN participants aged 14 years and from a subsample reassessed at age 19 years (n = 714). We applied sparse canonical correlation analyses (sCCA) to the cross-sectional and longitudinal data to extract modes with maximum covariation between neuroimaging and non-imaging measures. Separate sCCAs for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes confirmed that each imaging phenotype was correlated with non-imaging features (sCCA r range: 0.30–0.65, all PFDR {\textless} 0.001). Total intracranial volume and global measures of cortical thickness and surface area had the highest canonical cross-loadings ({\textbar}ρ{\textbar} = 0.31−0.61). Age, physical growth and sex had the highest association with adolescent brain structure ({\textbar}ρ{\textbar} = 0.24−0.62); at baseline, further significant positive associations were noted for cognitive measures while negative associations were observed at both time points for prenatal parental smoking, life events, and negative affect and substance use in youth ({\textbar}ρ{\textbar} = 0.10−0.23). Sex, physical growth and age are the dominant influences on adolescent brain development. We highlight the persistent negative influences of prenatal parental smoking and youth substance use as they are modifiable and of relevance for public health initiatives.},

	abstract = {Here, we investigated a possible common immune-related genetic link between these two phenomena in a population study of human adolescents. Hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) GM volumes were extracted from the IMAGEN database in 1563 14-year-olds recruited from the community in 4 european countries. Two polygenic risk scores (PRS) were constructed with inflammation-related SNPs; one accounting for hippocampal GM volume at age 14 and another for mPFC GM volume at age 14. We found 26 “independent” SNPs that correlated with the hippocampal volumes and 29 with the mPFC volumes. The predictive ability of both PRSs with regards to the presence of psychiatric symptoms at age 18 was investigated by correlating the PRSs with psychometric questionnaires obtained at age 18. The PRSs (but not control PRSs constructed with random SNPs) were found to have significant predictive power with regards to the presence of depressive symptoms, positive psychotic symptoms and externalizing symptoms in later adolescence. We also found that the effect of childhood maltreatment, one of the major environmental risk factors for depression and other mental disorders, interacted with the inflammation-related genetic effect. We next sought to validate this finding by investigating our set of inflammatory genes in a translational animal model of early life adversity. Mice were subjected to a protocol of maternal separation at an early post-natal age. We evaluated depressive behaviors in separated and non-separated mice at adolescence and their correlations with the concomitant expression of our genes in whole blood samples. We show that in mice, early life adversity affected the expression of our set of genes in peripheral blood, and that levels of expression correlated with symptoms of negative affects at adolescence. Overall, our translational findings in adolescent mice and men provide a novel validated gene-set of immune-related genes for further research in the early stages of mood disorders.},

	abstract = {Exposure to maltreatment during childhood is associated with structural changes throughout the brain. However, the structural differences that are most strongly associated with maltreatment remain unclear given the limited number of whole-brain studies. The present study used machine learning to identify if and how brain structure distinguished young adults with and without a history of maltreatment. Young adults (ages 18–21, n = 384) completed an assessment of childhood trauma exposure and a structural MRI as part of the IMAGEN study. Elastic net regularized regression was used to identify the structural features that identified those with a history of maltreatment. A generalizable model that included 7 cortical thicknesses, 15 surface areas, and 5 subcortical volumes was identified (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.001). Those with a maltreatment history had reduced surface areas and cortical thicknesses primarily in fronto-temporal regions. This group also had larger cortical thicknesses in occipital regions and surface areas in frontal regions. The results suggest childhood maltreatment is associated with multiple measures of structure throughout the brain. The use of a large sample without exposure to adulthood trauma provides further evidence for the unique contribution of childhood trauma to brain structure. The identified regions overlapped with regions associated with psychopathology in adults with maltreatment histories, which offers insights as to how these disorders manifest.},

	abstract = {Background
Dysfunctional reward processing is implicated in multiple mental disorders. Novelty seeking (NS) assesses preference for seeking novel experiences, which is linked to sensitivity to reward environmental cues.
Methods
A subset of 14-year-old adolescents (IMAGEN) with the top 20\% ranked high-NS scores was used to identify high-NS–associated multimodal components by supervised fusion. These features were then used to longitudinally predict five different risk scales for the same and unseen subjects (an independent dataset of subjects at 19 years of age that was not used in predictive modeling training at 14 years of age) (within IMAGEN, n ≈1100) and even for the corresponding symptom scores of five types of patient cohorts (non-IMAGEN), including drinking (n = 313), smoking (n = 104), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 320), major depressive disorder (n = 81), and schizophrenia (n = 147), as well as to classify different patient groups with diagnostic labels.
Results
Multimodal biomarkers, including the prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus, associated with high NS in 14-year-old adolescents were identified. The prediction models built on these features are able to longitudinally predict five different risk scales, including alcohol drinking, smoking, hyperactivity, depression, and psychosis for the same and unseen 19-year-old adolescents and even predict the corresponding symptom scores of five types of patient cohorts. Furthermore, the identified reward-related multimodal features can classify among attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia with an accuracy of 87.2\%.
Conclusions
Adolescents with higher NS scores can be used to reveal brain alterations in the reward-related system, implicating potential higher risk for subsequent development of multiple disorders. The identified high-NS–associated multimodal reward-related signatures may serve as a transdiagnostic neuroimaging biomarker to predict disease risks or severity.},

	abstract = {Mixed findings exist in studies comparing brain responses to reward in adolescents and adults. Here we examined the trajectories of brain response, functional connectivity and task-modulated network properties during reward processing with a large-sample longitudinal design. Participants from the IMAGEN study performed a Monetary Incentive Delay task during fMRI at timepoint 1 (T1; n = 1304, mean age=14.44 years old) and timepoint 2 (T2; n = 1241, mean age=19.09 years). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was administrated at both T1 and T2 to assess a participant’s alcohol use during the past year. Voxel-wise linear mixed effect models were used to compare whole brain response as well as functional connectivity of the ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation (large reward vs no-reward cue) between T1 and T2. In addition, task-modulated networks were constructed using generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis and summarized with graph theory metrics. To explore alcohol use in relation to development, participants with no/low alcohol use at T1 but increased alcohol use to hazardous use level at T2 (i.e., participants with AUDIT≤2 at T1 and ≥8 at T2) were compared against those with consistently low scores (i.e., participants with AUDIT≤2 at T1 and ≤7 at T2). Across the whole sample, lower brain response during reward anticipation was observed at T2 compared with T1 in bilateral caudate nucleus, VS, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal anterior cingulate as well as left precentral and postcentral gyrus. Conversely, greater response was observed bilaterally in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus and right precentral and postcentral gyrus at T2 (vs. T1). Increased functional connectivity with VS was found in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions at T2. Graph theory metrics of the task-modulated network showed higher inter-regional connectivity and topological efficiency at T2. Interactive effects between time (T1 vs. T2) and alcohol use group (low vs. high) on the functional connectivity were observed between left middle temporal gyrus and right VS and the characteristic shortest path length of the task-modulated networks. Collectively, these results demonstrate the utility of the MID task as a probe of typical brain response and network properties during development and of differences in these features related to adolescent drinking, a reward-related behaviour associated with heightened risk for future negative health outcomes.},

An individual's profile of functional connectivity across a face network can be shaped by common organizing principles, stable individual traits, and time-varying mental states. In the present study, we used data obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging in two cohorts, IMAGEN (N = 534) and ALSPAC (N = 465), to investigate - both at group and individual levels - the consistency of the regional profile of functional connectivity across populations (IMAGEN, ALSPAC) and time (Visits 1 to 3 in IMAGEN; age 14 to 22 years). At the group level, we found a robust canonical profile of connectivity both across populations and time. At the individual level, connectivity profiles deviated from the canonical profile, and the magnitude of this deviation related to the presence of psychopathology. These findings suggest that the brain processes faces in a highly stereotypical manner, and that the deviations from this normative pattern may be related to the risk of mental illness.},

	abstract = {Background
Eating disorders are common in adolescence and are devastating and strongly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Yet little is known about their etiology, knowing which would aid in developing effective preventive measures.
Methods
Longitudinal assessments of disordered eating behaviors (DEBs)—binge-eating, purging, and dieting—and comorbid psychopathology were measured in 1386 adolescents from the IMAGEN study. Development of DEBs and associated mental health problems was investigated by comparing participants who reported symptoms at ages 16 or 19 years, but not at age 14 years, with asymptomatic control participants. Voxel-based morphometry and psychopathological differences at age 14 were investigated to identify risk factors for the development of DEBs and associated mental health problems.
Results
DEBs and depressive symptoms developed together. Emotional and behavioral problems, including symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, predated their development. Alterations in frontostriatal brain areas also predated the development of DEBs and depressive symptoms. Specifically, development of binge-eating was predicted by higher gray matter volumes in the right putamen/globus pallidus at age 14. Conversely, development of purging and depressive symptoms was predicted by lower volumes in the medial orbitofrontal, dorsomedial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Lower gray matter volumes in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices mediated the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder symptoms and future purging and depressive symptoms.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that alterations in frontal brain circuits are part of the shared etiology among eating disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and depression and highlight the importance of a transdiagnostic approach to treating these conditions.},

	abstract = {Background While drinking alcohol, one must choose between the immediate rewarding effects and the delayed reward of a healthier lifestyle. Individuals differ in their devaluation of a delayed reward based on the time required to receive it, i.e., delay discounting (DD). Previous studies have shown that adolescents discount more steeply than adults and that steeper DD is associated with heavier alcohol use in both groups. Methods In a large-scale longitudinal study, we investigated whether higher rates of DD are an antecedent or a consequence of alcohol use during adolescent development. As part of the IMAGEN project, 2220 adolescents completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire as a DD measure, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and the Timeline Follow Back interview at ages 14, 16, 18, and 22. Bivariate latent growth curve models were applied to investigate the relationship between DD and drinking. To explore the consequences of drinking, we computed the cumulative alcohol consumption and correlated it with the development of discounting. A subsample of 221 participants completed an intertemporal choice task (iTeCh) during functional magnetic resonance imaging at ages 14, 16, and 18. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk drinkers on the development of neural processing during intertemporal choices. Results Overall, high rates of DD at age 14 predicted a greater increase in drinking over 8 years. In contrast, on average, moderate alcohol use did not affect DD from ages 14 to 22. Of note, we found indicators for less brain activity in top-down control areas during intertemporal choices in the participants who drank more. Conclusions Steep DD was shown to be a predictor rather than a consequence of alcohol use in low-level drinking adolescents. Important considerations for future longitudinal studies are the sampling strategies to be used and the reliability of the assessments.},

	abstract = {Background
Adolescent onset of depression is associated with long-lasting negative consequences. Identifying adolescents at risk for developing depression would enable the monitoring of risk factors and the development of early intervention strategies. Using machine learning to combine several risk factors from multiple modalities might allow prediction of depression onset at the individual level.
Methods
A subsample of a multisite longitudinal study in adolescents, the IMAGEN study, was used to predict future (subthreshold) major depressive disorder onset in healthy adolescents. Based on 2-year and 5-year follow-up data, participants were grouped into the following: 1) those developing a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or subthreshold major depressive disorder and 2) healthy control subjects. Baseline measurements of 145 variables from different modalities (clinical, cognitive, environmental, and structural magnetic resonance imaging) at age 14 years were used as input to penalized logistic regression (with different levels of penalization) to predict depression onset in a training dataset (n = 407). The features contributing the highest to the prediction were validated in an independent hold-out sample (three independent IMAGEN sites; n = 137).
Results
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting depression onset ranged between 0.70 and 0.72 in the training dataset. Baseline severity of depressive symptoms, female sex, neuroticism, stressful life events, and surface area of the supramarginal gyrus contributed most to the predictive model and predicted onset of depression, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.68 and 0.72 in the independent validation sample.
Conclusions
This study showed that depression onset in adolescents can be predicted based on a combination multimodal data of clinical characteristics, life events, personality traits, and brain structure variables.},

We estimated whether SCN differences are present in adults with AD and heavy-drinking adolescents at age 19 and age 14, prior to substantial exposure to alcohol. Design Cross-sectional sample of adults and a cohort of adolescents. Correlation matrices for cortical thicknesses across 68 regions were summarized with graph theoretic metrics. Setting and participants A total of 745 adults with AD and 979 non-dependent controls from 24 sites curated by the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA)–Addiction consortium, and 297 hazardous drinking adolescents and 594 controls at ages 19 and 14 from the IMAGEN study, all from Europe. Measurements Metrics of network segregation (modularity, clustering coefficient and local efficiency) and integration (average shortest path length and global efficiency). Findings The younger AD adults had lower network segregation and higher integration relative to non-dependent controls. Compared with controls, the hazardous drinkers at age 19 showed lower modularity [area-under-the-curve (AUC) difference = −0.0142, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = −0.1333, 0.0092; P-value = 0.017], clustering coefficient (AUC difference = −0.0164, 95\% CI = −0.1456, 0.0043; P-value = 0.008) and local efficiency (AUC difference = −0.0141, 95\% CI = −0.0097, 0.0034; P-value = 0.010), as well as lower average shortest path length (AUC difference = −0.0405, 95\% CI = −0.0392, 0.0096; P-value = 0.021) and higher global efficiency (AUC difference = 0.0044, 95\% CI = −0.0011, 0.0043; P-value = 0.023). The same pattern was present at age 14 with lower clustering coefficient (AUC difference = −0.0131, 95\% CI = −0.1304, 0.0033; P-value = 0.024), lower average shortest path length (AUC difference = −0.0362, 95\% CI = −0.0334, 0.0118; P-value = 0.019) and higher global efficiency (AUC difference = 0.0035, 95\% CI = −0.0011, 0.0038; P-value = 0.048). Conclusions Cross-sectional analyses indicate that a specific structural covariance network profile is an early marker of alcohol dependence in adults. Similar effects in a cohort of heavy-drinking adolescents, observed at age 19 and prior to substantial alcohol exposure at age 14, suggest that this pattern may be a pre-existing risk factor for problematic drinking.},

	abstract = {Background: Autistic traits are commonly viewed as dimensional in nature, and as continuously distributed in the general population. In this respect, the identification of predictive values of markers such as subtle autism-related alterations in brain morphology for parameter values of autistic traits could increase our understanding of this dimensional occasion. However, currently, very little is known about how these traits correspond to alterations in brain morphology in typically developing individuals, particularly during a time period where changes due to brain development processes do not provide a bias. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed brain volume, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in a cohort of 14–15-year-old adolescents (N = 285, female: N = 162) and tested their predictive value for autistic traits, assessed with the social responsiveness scale (SRS) two years later at the age of 16–17 years, using a regression-based approach. We found that autistic traits were significantly predicted by volumetric changes in the amygdala (r = 0.181), cerebellum (r = 0.128) and hippocampus (r = −0.181, r = −0.203), both in boys and girls. Moreover, the CT of the superior frontal region was negatively correlated (r = −0.144) with SRS scores. Furthermore, we observed a significant association between the SRS total score and smaller left putamen volume, specifically in boys (r = −0.217), but not in girls. Our findings suggest that neural correlates of autistic traits also seem to lie on a continuum in the general population, are determined by limbic–striatal neuroanatomical brain areas, and are partly dependent on sex. As we imaged adolescents from a large population-based cohort within a small age range, these data may help to increase the understanding of autistic-like occasions in otherwise typically developing individuals.},

Disinhibition involves an impulsive, unrestrained cognitive–behavioral style; callousness entails a dispositional lack of social-emotional sensitivity. Participants were European adolescents from the multisite IMAGEN project who completed questionnaires and clinical interviews at ages 14 (N = 1,504, Mage = 14.41, 51.13\% female) and 16 (N = 1,407, Mage = 16.46, 51.88\% female). Disinhibition was related concurrently and prospectively to greater symptoms of conduct disorder, ADHD, and alcohol use disorder; higher scores on a general externalizing factor; and greater likelihood of having tried an illicit substance. Callousness was selectively related to greater conduct disorder symptoms. These findings indicate disinhibition confers broad liability for externalizing spectrum disorders, perhaps due to its affiliated deficits in executive function. In contrast, callousness appears to represent more specific liability for antagonistic (aggressive/exploitative) forms of externalizing, as exemplified by antisocial behavior. Results support the utility of developmental-ontogenetic and hierarchical-dimensional models of psychopathology and have important implications for early assessment of risk for externalizing problems.

	abstract = {Background
On a theoretical level, impulsivity represents a multidimensional construct associated with acting without foresight, inefficient inhibitory response control, and alterations in reward processing. On an empirical level, relationships and changes in associations between different measures of impulsivity from adolescence into young adulthood and their relation to neural activity during inhibitory control and reward anticipation have not been fully understood.
Methods
We used data from IMAGEN, a longitudinal multicenter, population-based cohort study in which 2034 healthy adolescents were investigated at age 14, and 1383 were reassessed as young adults at age 19. We measured the construct of trait impulsivity using self-report questionnaires and neurocognitive indices of decisional impulsivity. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed brain activity during inhibition error processing using the stop signal task and during reward anticipation in the monetary incentive delay task. Correlations were analyzed, and mixed-effect models were fitted to explore developmental and predictive effects.
Results
All self-report and neurocognitive measures of impulsivity proved to be correlated during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, pre-supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus activity during inhibition error processing was associated with trait impulsivity in adolescence, whereas in young adulthood, a trend-level association with reward anticipation activity in the ventral striatum was found. For adult delay discounting, a trend-level predictive effect of adolescent neural activity during inhibition error processing emerged.
Conclusions
Our findings help to inform theories of impulsivity about the development of its multidimensional nature and associated brain activity patterns and highlight the need for taking functional brain development into account when evaluating neuromarker candidates.},

Also, eveningness in adolescence has been found to predict later onset of depressive symptoms. However, no previous study has investigated structural variations associated with chronotype in early adolescence and how this adds to the development of depressive symptoms.
Method
Assessment of 128 community-based adolescents (51\% girls) at age 14 and 19 years was performed. Using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, baseline (at age 14) regional gray matter volumes (GMVs), follow-up (at age 19) regional GMVs, and longitudinal changes (between 14 and 19) associated with Morningness/Eveningness Scale in Children score and sleep habits at baseline were measured. The association of GMV with depressive symptoms at 19 years was studied, and the role of potential clinical and genetic factors as mediators and moderators was assessed.
Results
Higher eveningness was associated with larger GMV in the right medial prefrontal cortex at ages 14 and 19 in the whole sample. GMV in this region related to depressive symptoms at age 19 in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val/Val, but not in Met COMT, carriers. Larger GMV also was observed in the right fusiform gyrus at age 14, which was explained by later wake-up time during weekends.
Conclusion
In adolescence, eveningness and its related sleep habits correlated with distinct developmental patterns. Eveningness was specifically associated with GMV changes in the medial prefrontal cortex; this could serve as a brain vulnerability factor for later self-reported depressive symptoms in COMT Val/Val carriers.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic and fatal disease. The main impediment of the AUD therapy is a high probability of relapse to alcohol abuse even after prolonged abstinence. The molecular mechanisms of cue-induced relapse are not well established, despite the fact that they may offer new targets for the treatment of AUD. Using a comprehensive animal model of AUD, virally-mediated and amygdala-targeted genetic manipulations by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and ex vivo electrophysiology, we identify a mechanism that selectively controls cue-induced alcohol relapse and AUD symptom severity. This mechanism is based on activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc)/ARG3.1-dependent plasticity of the amygdala synapses. In humans, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARC gene and their methylation predicting not only amygdala size, but also frequency of alcohol use, even at the onset of regular consumption. Targeting Arc during alcohol cue exposure may thus be a selective new mechanism for relapse prevention.},

	abstract = {Recent longitudinal studies in youth have reported MRI correlates of prospective anxiety symptoms during adolescence, a vulnerable period for the onset of anxiety disorders. However, their predictive value has not been established. Individual prediction through machine-learning algorithms might help bridge the gap to clinical relevance. A voting classifier with Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression algorithms was used to evaluate the predictive pertinence of gray matter volumes of interest and psychometric scores in the detection of prospective clinical anxiety. Participants with clinical anxiety at age 18–23 (N = 156) were investigated at age 14 along with healthy controls (N = 424). Shapley values were extracted for in-depth interpretation of feature importance. Prospective prediction of pooled anxiety disorders relied mostly on psychometric features and achieved moderate performance (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.68), while generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) prediction achieved similar performance. MRI regional volumes did not improve the prediction performance of prospective pooled anxiety disorders with respect to psychometric features alone, but they improved the prediction performance of GAD, with the caudate and pallidum volumes being among the most contributing features. To conclude, in non-anxious 14 year old adolescents, future clinical anxiety onset 4–8 years later could be individually predicted. Psychometric features such as neuroticism, hopelessness and emotional symptoms were the main contributors to pooled anxiety disorders prediction. Neuroanatomical data, such as caudate and pallidum volume, proved valuable for GAD and should be included in prospective clinical anxiety prediction in adolescents.},

PCA produced a spatially broad first principal component (PC1) that was reproducible across datasets. Then PC1 derived from healthy adult participants was compared to the pattern of CT differences associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders comprising a total of 14,886 cases and 20,962 controls from seven ENIGMA disease-related working groups, normative maturation and aging comprising a total of 17,697 scans from the ABCD Study® and the IMAGEN developmental study, and 17,075 participants from the ENIGMA Lifespan working group, as well as gene expression maps from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Results revealed substantial spatial correspondences between PC1 and widespread lower CT observed in numerous psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the PC1 pattern was also correlated with the spatial pattern of normative maturation and aging. The transcriptional analysis identified a set of genes including KCNA2, KCNS1 and KCNS2 with expression patterns closely related to the spatial pattern of PC1. The gene category enrichment analysis indicated that the transcriptional correlations of PC1 were enriched to multiple gene ontology categories and were specifically over-represented starting at late childhood, coinciding with the onset of significant cortical maturation and emergence of psychopathology during the prepubertal-to-pubertal transition. Collectively, the present study reports a reproducible latent pattern of CT that captures interregional profiles of cortical changes in both normative brain maturation and a spectrum of psychiatric disorders. The pubertal timing of the expression of PC1-related genes implicates disrupted neurodevelopment in the pathogenesis of the spectrum of psychiatric diseases emerging during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Background
Negative life events (NLEs) increase the risk for externalizing behaviors (EBs) and internalizing behaviors (IBs) in adolescence and adult psychopathology. DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs.
Methods
To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs.
Results
No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 × 10−8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD.},

	abstract = {Although many studies of the adolescent brain identified positive associations between cognitive abilities and cortical thickness, little is known about mechanisms underlying such brain-behavior relationships. With experience-induced plasticity playing an important role in shaping the cerebral cortex throughout life, it is likely that some of the inter-individual variations in cortical thickness could be explained by genetic variations in relevant molecular processes, as indexed by a polygenic score of neuronal plasticity (PGS-NP). Here, we studied associations between PGS-NP, cognitive abilities, and thickness of the cerebral cortex, estimated from magnetic resonance images, in the Saguenay Youth Study (SYS, 533 females, 496 males: age=15.0 ± 1.8 years of age; cross-sectional), and the IMAGEN Study (566 females, 556 males; between 14 and 19 years; longitudinal). Using Gene Ontology, we first identified 199 genes implicated in neuronal plasticity, which mapped to 155,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Second, we estimated their effect sizes from an educational attainment meta-GWAS to build a PGS-NP. Third, we examined a possible moderating role of PGS-NP in the relationship between performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), and its subtests, and the thickness of 34 cortical regions. In SYS, we observed a significant interaction between PGS-NP and object assembly vis-à-vis thickness in male adolescents (p = 0.026). A median-split analysis showed that, in males with a ‘high’ PGS-NP, stronger associations between object assembly and thickness were found in regions with larger age-related changes in thickness (r = 0.55, p = 0.00075). Although the interaction between PIQ and PGS-NP was non-significant (p = 0.064), we performed a similar median-split analysis. Again, in the high PGS-NP males, positive associations between PIQ and thickness were observed in regions with larger age-related changes in thickness (r = 0.40, p = 0.018). In the IMAGEN cohort, we did not replicate the first set of results (interaction between PGS-NP and cognitive abilities via-a-vis cortical thickness) while we did observe the same relationship between the brain-behaviour relationship and (longitudinal) changes in cortical thickness (Matrix reasoning: r = 0.63, p = 6.5e-05). No statistically significant results were observed in female adolescents in either cohort. Overall, these cross-sectional and longitudinal results suggest that molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal plasticity may contribute to inter-individual variations of cortical thickness related to cognitive abilities during adolescence in a sex-specific manner.},

In this longitudinal machine learning (ML) study, we could predict AAM significantly from brain structure (T1-weighted imaging and DTI) with accuracies of 73 -78\% in the IMAGEN dataset (n∼1182). Our results not only show that structural differences in brain can predict AAM, but also suggests that such differences might precede AAM behavior in the data. We predicted 10 phenotypes of AAM at age 22 using brain MRI features at ages 14, 19, and 22. Binge drinking was found to be the most predictable phenotype. The most informative brain features were located in the ventricular CSF, and in white matter tracts of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and brain stem. In the cortex, they were spread across the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes and in the cingulate cortex. We also experimented with four different ML models and several confound control techniques. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with rbf kernel and Gradient Boosting consistently performed better than the linear models, linear SVM and Logistic Regression. Our study also demonstrates how the choice of the predicted phenotype, ML model, and confound correction technique are all crucial decisions in an explorative ML study analyzing psychiatric disorders with small effect sizes such as AAM.},

	abstract = {Background
Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are known to be associated with better white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in older adults in cross-sectional studies. However, no studies have investigated the association between PA levels and the evolution of DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity).
Objectives
To examine the cross-sectional associations between PA levels and DTI parameters, then to investigate the association between baseline PA levels and the evolution of DTI parameters in older adults.
Methods
Data on magnetic resonance imaging with DTI method from the Multidomain Alzheimer’s Preventive Trial (MAPT) study were used; 228 participants had data on DTI measured at three time-points over five years. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were acquired for six different brain regions.
Results
No significant associations were found in the cross-sectional analyses. Only one association was found: compared with active individuals, a faster worsening in the mean diffusivity of the uncinate fasciculus region was found in inactive individuals (-5.0 × 10-6 (-9.5 × 10-5, 4.9 × 10-6)).
Conclusions
In this study, we found that the condition of the uncinate fasciculus region may be susceptible to changes in PA levels in older adults. Longitudinal studies that assess fitness and PA using objective measurements (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness and accelerometry) could shed some new light on this topic.},

	abstract = {Environmental adversities constitute potent risk factors for psychiatric disorders. Evidence suggests the brain adapts to adversity, possibly in an adversity-type and region-specific manner. However, the long-term effects of adversity on brain structure and the association of individual neurobiological heterogeneity with behavior have yet to be elucidated. Here we estimated normative models of structural brain development based on a lifespan adversity profile in a longitudinal at-risk cohort aged 25 years (n = 169). This revealed widespread morphometric changes in the brain, with partially adversity-specific features. This pattern was replicated at the age of 33 years (n = 114) and in an independent sample at 22 years (n = 115). At the individual level, greater volume contractions relative to the model were predictive of future anxiety. We show a stable neurobiological signature of adversity that persists into adulthood and emphasize the importance of considering individual-level rather than group-level predictions to explain emerging psychopathology.},

	abstract = {Animal studies have shown that the adolescent brain is sensitive to disruptions in endocannabinoid signaling, resulting in altered neurodevelopment and lasting behavioral effects. However, few studies have investigated ties between cannabis use and adolescent brain development in humans.To examine the degree to which magnetic resonance (MR) imaging–assessed cerebral cortical thickness development is associated with cannabis use in a longitudinal sample of adolescents.Data were obtained from the community-based IMAGEN cohort study, conducted across 8 European sites. Baseline data used in the present study were acquired from March 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, and follow-up data were acquired from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016. A total of 799 IMAGEN participants were identified who reported being cannabis naive at study baseline and had behavioral and neuroimaging data available at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020.Cannabis use was assessed at baseline and 5-year follow-up with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs. Anatomical MR images were acquired with a 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared gradient echo sequence. Quality-controlled native MR images were processed through the CIVET pipeline, version 2.1.0.The study evaluated 1598 MR images from 799 participants (450 female participants [56.3\%]; mean [SD] age, 14.4 [0.4] years at baseline and 19.0 [0.7] years at follow-up). At 5-year follow-up, cannabis use (from 0 to \&gt;40 uses) was negatively associated with thickness in left prefrontal (peak: t785 = –4.87, cluster size = 1558 vertices; P = 1.10 × 10−6, random field theory cluster corrected) and right prefrontal (peak: t785 = –4.27, cluster size = 1551 vertices; P = 2.81 × 10−5, random field theory cluster corrected) cortices. There were no significant associations between lifetime cannabis use at 5-year follow-up and baseline cortical thickness, suggesting that the observed neuroanatomical differences did not precede initiation of cannabis use. Longitudinal analysis revealed that age-related cortical thinning was qualified by cannabis use in a dose-dependent fashion such that greater use, from baseline to follow-up, was associated with increased thinning in left prefrontal (peak: t815.27 = –4.24, cluster size = 3643 vertices; P = 2.28 × 10−8, random field theory cluster corrected) and right prefrontal (peak: t813.30 = –4.71, cluster size = 2675 vertices; P = 3.72 × 10−8, random field theory cluster corrected) cortices. The spatial pattern of cannabis-related thinning was associated with age-related thinning in this sample (r = 0.540; P \&lt; .001), and a positron emission tomography–assessed cannabinoid 1 receptor–binding map derived from a separate sample of participants (r = −0.189; P \&lt; .001). Analysis revealed that thinning in right prefrontal cortices, from baseline to follow-up, was associated with attentional impulsiveness at follow-up.Results suggest that cannabis use during adolescence is associated with altered neurodevelopment, particularly in cortices rich in cannabinoid 1 receptors and undergoing the greatest age-related thickness change in middle to late adolescence.},

	abstract = {While there is substantial evidence that cannabis use is associated with differences in human brain development, most of this evidence is correlational in nature. Bayesian causal network (BCN) modeling attempts to identify probable causal relationships in correlational data using conditional probabilities to estimate directional associations between a set of interrelated variables. In this study, we employed BCN modeling in 637 adolescents from the IMAGEN study who were cannabis naïve at age 14 to provide evidence that the accelerated prefrontal cortical thinning found previously in adolescent cannabis users by Albaugh et al. [1] is a result of cannabis use causally affecting neurodevelopment. BCNs incorporated data on cannabis use, prefrontal cortical thickness, and other factors related to both brain development and cannabis use, including demographics, psychopathology, childhood adversity, and other substance use. All BCN algorithms strongly suggested a directional relationship from adolescent cannabis use to accelerated cortical thinning. While BCN modeling alone does not prove a causal relationship, these results are consistent with a body of animal and human research suggesting that adolescent cannabis use adversely affects brain development.},

Brain mechanisms underlying risk of alcohol misuse may inform prevention and intervention efforts.To identify neuromarkers of alcohol misuse using a data-driven approach, with specific consideration of neurodevelopmental sex differences.Longitudinal multisite functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at ages 14 and 19 years were used to assess whole-brain patterns of functional organization associated with current and future alcohol use risk as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Primary data were collected by the IMAGEN consortium, a European multisite study of adolescent neurodevelopment. Model generalizability was further tested using data acquired in a single-site study of college alcohol consumption conducted in the US. The primary sample was a developmental cohort of 1359 adolescents with neuroimaging, phenotyping, and alcohol use data. Model generalizability was further assessed in a separate cohort of 114 individuals.Brain-behavior model accuracy, as defined by the correspondence between model-predicted and actual AUDIT scores in held-out testing data, Bonferroni corrected across the number of models run at each time point, 2-tailed α \&lt; .008, as determined via permutation testing.Among 1359 individuals in the study, the mean (SD) age was 14.42 (0.40) years, and 729 individuals (54\%) were female. The data-driven, whole-brain connectivity approach identified networks associated with vulnerability for future and current AUDIT-defined alcohol use risk (primary outcome, as specified above, future: ρ, 0.22; P \&lt; .001 and present: ρ, 0.27; P \&lt; .001). Results further indicated sex divergence in the accuracies of brain-behavior models, such that female-only models consistently outperformed male-only models. Specifically, female-only models identified networks conferring vulnerability for future and current severity using data acquired during both reward and inhibitory fMRI tasks. In contrast, male-only models were successful in accurately identifying networks using data acquired during the inhibitory control—but not reward—task, indicating domain specificity of alcohol use risk networks in male adolescents only.These data suggest that interventions focusing on inhibitory control processes may be effective in combating alcohol use risk in male adolescents but that both inhibitory and reward-related processes are likely of relevance to alcohol use behaviors in female adolescents. They further identify novel networks of alcohol use risk in youth, which may be used to identify adolescents who are at risk and inform intervention efforts.},

However, genetics and SES are correlated, and no prior study has assessed their neural associations independently. Here we used a polygenic score for educational attainment (EduYears-PGS), as well as SES, in a longitudinal study of 551 adolescents to tease apart genetic and environmental associations with brain development and cognition. Subjects received a structural MRI scan at ages 14 and 19. At both time points, they performed three working memory (WM) tasks. SES and EduYears-PGS were correlated (r = 0.27) and had both common and independent associations with brain structure and cognition. Specifically, lower SES was related to less total cortical surface area and lower WM. EduYears-PGS was also related to total cortical surface area, but in addition had a regional association with surface area in the right parietal lobe, a region related to nonverbal cognitive functions, including mathematics, spatial cognition, and WM. SES, but not EduYears-PGS, was related to a change in total cortical surface area from age 14 to 19. This study demonstrates a regional association of EduYears-PGS and the independent prediction of SES with cognitive function and brain development. It suggests that the SES inequalities, in particular parental education, are related to global aspects of cortical development, and exert a persistent influence on brain development during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Hemispheric lateralization and its origins have been of great interest in neuroscience for over a century. The left–right asymmetry in cortical thickness may stem from differential maturation of the cerebral cortex in the two hemispheres. Here, we investigated the spatial pattern of hemispheric differences in cortical thinning during adolescence, and its relationship with the density of neurotransmitter receptors and homotopic functional connectivity. Using longitudinal data from IMAGEN study (N = 532), we found that many cortical regions in the frontal and temporal lobes thinned more in the right hemisphere than in the left. Conversely, several regions in the occipital and parietal lobes thinned less in the right (vs. left) hemisphere. We then revealed that regions thinning more in the right (vs. left) hemispheres had higher density of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in the right (vs. left) side. Moreover, the hemispheric differences in cortical thinning were predicted by homotopic functional connectivity. Specifically, regions with stronger homotopic functional connectivity showed a more symmetrical rate of cortical thinning between the left and right hemispheres, compared with regions with weaker homotopic functional connectivity. Based on these findings, we suggest that the typical patterns of hemispheric differences in cortical thinning may reflect the intrinsic organization of the neurotransmitter systems and related patterns of homotopic functional connectivity.},

	abstract = {PurposePredicting H3.1, TP53, and ACVR1 mutations in DIPG could aid in the selection of therapeutic options. The contribution of clinical data and multi-modal MRI were studied for these three predictive tasks. To keep the maximum number of subjects, which is essential for a rare disease, missing data were considered. A multi-modal model was proposed, collecting all available data for each patient, without performing any imputation.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 80 patients with confirmed DIPG and at least one of the four MR modalities (T1w, T1c, T2w, and FLAIR), acquired with two different MR scanners was built. A pipeline including standardization of MR data and extraction of radiomic features within the tumor was applied. The values of radiomic features between the two MR scanners were realigned using the ComBat method. For each prediction task, the most robust features were selected based on a recursive feature elimination with cross-validation. Five different models, one based on clinical data and one per MR modality, were developed using logistic regression classifiers. The prediction of the multi-modal model was defined as the average of all possible prediction results among five for each patient. The performances of the models were compared using a leave-one-out approach.ResultsThe percentage of missing modalities ranged from 6 to 11\% across modalities and tasks. The performance of each individual model was dependent on each specific task, with an AUC of the ROC curve ranging from 0.63 to 0.80. The multi-modal model outperformed the clinical model for each prediction tasks, thus demonstrating the added value of MRI. Furthermore, regardless of performance criteria, the multi-modal model came in the first place or second place (very close to first). In the leave-one-out approach, the prediction of H3.1 (resp. ACVR1 and TP53) mutations achieved a balanced accuracy of 87.8\% (resp. 82.1 and 78.3\%).ConclusionCompared with a single modality approach, the multi-modal model combining multiple MRI modalities and clinical features was the most powerful to predict H3.1, ACVR1, and TP53 mutations and provided prediction, even in the case of missing modality. It could be proposed in the absence of a conclusive biopsy.},

	abstract = {Tumour lesion segmentation is a key step to study and characterise cancer from MR neuroradiological images. Presently, numerous deep learning segmentation architectures have been shown to perform well on the specific tumour type they are trained on (e.g., glioblastoma in brain hemispheres). However, a high performing network heavily trained on a given tumour type may perform poorly on a rare tumour type for which no labelled cases allows training or transfer learning. Yet, because some visual similarities exist nevertheless between common and rare tumours, in the lesion and around it, one may split the problem into two steps: object detection and segmentation. For each step, trained networks on common lesions could be used on rare ones following a domain adaptation scheme without extra fine-tuning. This work proposes a resilient tumour lesion delineation strategy, based on the combination of established elementary networks that achieve detection and segmentation. Our strategy allowed us to achieve robust segmentation inference on a rare tumour located in an unseen tumour context region during training. As an example of a rare tumour, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), we achieve an average dice score of 0.62 without further training or network architecture adaptation.},

Isolating homogenized subtypes could provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms and an overall better understanding of ASD. A total of 1093 participants from the population-based “Healthy Brain Network” cohort (Child Mind Institute in the New York City area, USA) were selected based on score availability in behaviors relevant to ASD, aged 6–18 and IQ {\textgreater}= 70. All participants underwent an unsupervised clustering analysis on behavioral dimensions to reveal subgroups with ASD traits, identified by the presence of social deficits. Analysis revealed three socially impaired ASD traits subgroups: (1) high in emotionally dysfunctional traits, (2) high in ADHD-like traits, and (3) high in anxiety and depressive symptoms. 527 subjects had good quality structural MRI T1 data. Site effects on cortical features were adjusted using the ComBat method. Neuroimaging analyses compared cortical thickness, gyrification, and surface area, and were controlled for age, gender, and IQ, and corrected for multiple comparisons. Structural neuroimaging analyses contrasting one combined heterogeneous ASD traits group against controls did not yield any significant differences. Unique cortical signatures, however, were observed within each of the three individual ASD traits subgroups versus controls. These observations provide evidence of ASD traits subtypes, and confirm the necessity of applying dimensional approaches to extract meaningful differences, thus reducing heterogeneity and paving the way to better understanding ASD traits.},

We divided all individuals genetically confirmed of British ancestry into two sub-cohorts (12,162 and 3435 subjects for discovery and replication samples, respectively). We found that the heritability of the sulcal opening ranges from 15 to 45\% (SE = 4.8\%). We identified 4 new loci that contribute to this opening, including one that also affects the sulci grey matter thickness. We identified the most significant variant (rs864736) on this locus as being an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the KCNK2 gene. This gene regulates the immune-cell into the central nervous system (CNS) and controls the CNS inflammation, which is implicated in cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic contribution to cortical shrinking and promote further investigation into these variants and genes in pathological context such as Alzheimer’s disease in which brain shrinkage is a key biomarker.},

	abstract = {Background
Lung cancer, and more precisely, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality due to its high prevalence. Likewise, brain metastases from lung cancer are the most frequent type of secondary brain tumors. Different prognostic scores have been proposed to better stratify the treatment of brain metastases. More recently, lung GPA has been updated considering two frequent molecular characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma: EGFR and ALK alterations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the crosstalk between imaging features and the currently used prognostic scores is unknown.We sought to analyze the clinical value of radiomics data in the prediction of survival in patients with brain mets from NSCLC.

Material and Methods
We have selected 29 patients with brain metastases of NSCLC treated during 2015–2016 at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. We selected patients with neither previous history of brain mets nor brain surgery and high-quality structural MRI.We extracted 1428 radiomic features per patient, including: first-order statistics, volume, shape, texture and wavelet analysis using pyradiomics on Gadolinium enhanced T1 and FLAIR RM images. Using the plsRcox package, several Cox models were constructed with either clinical (GPA score, EGFR mutation and ALK fusion status) or radiomics features or both. The goodness of fit was assessed with the Harrell’s concordance index using 5 fold cross-validation.

Results
The performance of the radiomics model (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.88, SD 0.08) to predict OS was the best compared to the prediction using clinical data (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.77, SD 0.25). Surprisingly, the addition of clinical data to the radiomics model decreased the performance of OS prediction (mean Harrell’s C-index 0.83, SD 0.17).

Conclusion
Radiomics analysis of brain mets from NSCLC may provide additional clinically relevant data on the survival, in a non-invasive way. The results of this small cohort are currently being validated in a larger dataset of patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether deviations in brain and behavioral development, which may underpin elevated substance use during adolescence, are predispositions for or consequences of substance use initiation. Here, we examine behavioral and neuroimaging indices at early and mid-adolescence in drug-naive youths to identify possible predisposing factors for substance use initiation and its possible consequences.
METHOD: Among 304 drug-naive adolescents at baseline (age 14 years) from the IMAGEN dataset, 83 stayed drug-naive, 133 used alcohol on 1 to 9 occasions, 42 on 10 to 19 occasions, 27 on 20 to 39 occasions, and 19 on {\textgreater}40 occasions at follow-up (age 16 years). Baseline measures included brain activation during the Monetary Incentive Delay task. Data at both baseline and follow-up included measures of trait impulsivity and delay discounting.
RESULTS: From baseline to follow-up, impulsivity decreased in the 0 and 1- to 9-occasions groups (p {\textless} .004), did not change in the 10- to 19-occasions and 20- to 29-occasions groups (p {\textgreater} .294), and uncharacteristically increased in the {\textgreater}40-occasions group (p = .046). Furthermore, blunted medial orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome at baseline significantly predicted higher alcohol use frequency at follow-up, above and beyond behavioral and clinical variables (p = .008).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the transition from no use to frequent drinking in early to mid-adolescence may disrupt normative developmental changes in behavioral control. In addition, blunted activity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome may underscore a predisposition toward the development of more severe alcohol use in adolescents. This distinction is clinically important, as it informs early intervention efforts in preventing the onset of substance use disorder in adolescents.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Children experiencing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms may retain symptoms into adulthood, but little is known about the underlying mechanism.
METHOD: To identify biomarkers of persistent ADHD symptom development, we carried out whole-brain analyses of neuroimaging data during the anticipation phase of the Monetary-Incentive-Delay (MID) task in 1,368 adolescents recruited by the IMAGEN Consortium at age 14 years, whose behavioral measurements were followed up longitudinally at age 16. In particular, we focused on comparing individuals with persistent high ADHD symptoms at both ages 14 and 16 years to unaffected control individuals, but also exploring which individuals demonstrating symptom remission (with high ADHD symptoms at age 14 but much reduced at age 16).
RESULTS: We identified reduced activations in the medial frontal cortex and the thalamus during reward anticipation as neuro-biomarkers for persistent ADHD symptoms across time. The genetic relevance of the above findings was further supported by the associations of the polygenic risk scores of ADHD with both the persistent and control status and the activations of both brain regions. Furthermore, in an exploratory analysis, the thalamic activation might also help to distinguish persons with persistent ADHD from those remitted in both an exploratory sample (odds ratio = 9.43, p {\textless} .001) and an independent generalization sample (odds ratio = 4.64, p = .003).
CONCLUSION: Using a well-established and widely applied functional magnetic resonance imaging task, we have identified neural biomarkers that could discriminate ADHD symptoms that persist throughout adolescence from controls and potentially those likely to remit during adolescent development as well.},

	abstract = {The perspective of personalized medicine for brain disorders requires efficient learning models for anatomical neuroimaging-based prediction of clinical conditions. There is now a consensus on the benefit of deep learning (DL) in addressing many medical imaging tasks, such as image segmentation. However, for single-subject prediction problems, recent studies yielded contradictory results when comparing DL with Standard Machine Learning (SML) on top of classical feature extraction. Most existing comparative studies were limited in predicting phenotypes of little clinical interest, such as sex and age, and using a single dataset. Moreover, they conducted a limited analysis of the employed image pre-processing and feature selection strategies. This paper extensively compares DL and SML prediction capacity on five multi-site problems, including three increasingly complex clinical applications in psychiatry namely schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. To compensate for the relative scarcity of neuroimaging data on these clinical datasets, we also evaluate three pre-training strategies for transfer learning from brain imaging of the general healthy population: self-supervised learning, generative modeling and supervised learning with age. Overall, we find similar performance between randomly initialized DL and SML for the three clinical tasks and a similar scaling trend for sex prediction. This was replicated on an external dataset. We also show highly correlated discriminative brain regions between DL and linear ML models in all problems. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training on large-scale healthy population imaging datasets (N≈10k), along with Deep Ensemble, allows DL to learn robust and transferable representations to smaller-scale clinical datasets (N≤1k). It largely outperforms SML on 2 out of 3 clinical tasks both in internal and external test sets. These findings suggest that the improvement of DL over SML in anatomical neuroimaging mainly comes from its capacity to learn meaningful and useful abstract representations of the brain anatomy, and it sheds light on the potential of transfer learning for personalized medicine in psychiatry},
