	abstract = {A very active field of research in Bioinformatics is to integrate structure in Machine Learning methods. Methods recently developed claim that they allow simultaneously to link the computed model to the graphical structure of the data set and to select a handful of important features in the analysis. However, there is still no way to simulate data for which we can separate the three properties that such method claim to achieve. These properties are: (i) the sparsity of the solution, i.e., the fact the the model is based on a few features of the data; (ii) the structure of the model; (iii) the relation between the structure of the model and the graphical model behind the generation of the data.},

	abstract = {Despite significant progress in the field, the detection of fMRI signal changes during hallucinatory events remains difficult and time-consuming. This article first proposes a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify resting-state fMRI periods that precede hallucinations versus periods that do not. When applied to whole-brain fMRI data, state-of-the-art classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), yield dense solutions that are difficult to interpret. We proposed to extend the existing sparse classification methods by taking the spatial structure of brain images into account with structured sparsity using the total variation penalty. Based on this approach, we obtained reliable classifying performances associated with interpretable predictive patterns, composed of two clearly identifiable clusters in speech-related brain regions. The variation in transition-to-hallucination functional patterns not only from one patient to another but also from one occurrence to the next (e.g., also depending on the sensory modalities involved) appeared to be the major difficulty when developing effective classifiers. Consequently, second, this article aimed to characterize the variability within the prehallucination patterns using an extension of principal component analysis with spatial constraints. The principal components (PCs) and the associated basis patterns shed light on the intrinsic structures of the variability present in the dataset. Such results are promising in the scope of innovative fMRI-guided therapy for drug-resistant hallucinations, such as fMRI-based neurofeedback.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous pathological studies in humans or in animal models have shown alterations of small arteries and veins within white matter lesions in cerebral small vessel disease. We aimed to evaluate in vivo, the integrity of the cerebral venous network using high-resolution MRI both within and outside white matter hyperintensities in cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
METHODS: High-resolution T2*-weighted images were obtained at 7-T in 13 CADASIL patients with no or only mild symptoms and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. Macroscopic veins were automatically counted in the centrum semiovale and compared between patients and controls. In addition, T2* was compared between groups in the normal-appearing white matter.
RESULTS: Vein density was found lower in CADASIL patients compared with that in controls (-14.6\% in patients, P{\textless}0.001). This was detected both within and outside white matter hyperintensities. Mean T2*, that is presumably inversely related to the venous density, was also found increased in normal-appearing white matter of patients (+7.2\%, P=0.006). All results were independent from the extent of white matter hyperintensities.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in the number of visible veins was observed in the centrum semiovale of CADASIL patients both within and outside white matter hyperintensities, together with an increase of T2* in the normal-appearing white matter. Additional studies are needed to decipher the exact implication of such vasculature changes in the appearance of white matter lesions.},

The aim of this study was to investigate cortical alterations using both high-resolution T2* acquisitions obtained with 7 Tesla MRI and structural T1 images with 3 Tesla MRI in CADASIL patients with no or only mild symptomatology (modified Rankin's scale ≤1 and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥24).
METHODS: Complete reconstructions of the cortex using 7 Tesla T2* acquisitions with 0.7 mm isotropic resolution were obtained in 11 patients (52.1±13.2 years, 36\% male) and 24 controls (54.8±11.0 years, 42\% male). Seven Tesla T2* within the cortex and cortical thickness and morphology obtained from 3 Tesla images were compared between CADASIL and control subjects using general linear models.
RESULTS: MMSE, brain volume, cortical thickness and global sulcal morphology did not differ between groups. By contrast, T2* measured by 7 Tesla MRI was significantly increased in frontal, parietal, occipital and cingulate cortices in patients after correction for multiple testing. These changes were not related to white matter lesions, lacunes or microhemorrhages in patients having no brain atrophy compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Seven Tesla MRI, by contrast to state of the art post-processing of 3 Tesla acquisitions, shows diffuse T2* alterations within the cortical mantle in CADASIL whose origin remains to be determined.},

L’étude en neuroimagerie des maladies mentales (troubles de l’humeur, schizophrénie, trouble du spectre autistique) a, jusqu’alors, été abordée par des méthodes classiques d’analyses statistiques dites « univariées ». Ces méthodes ont permis d’identifier de nombreuses modifications cérébrales structurelles et fonctionnelles associées à ces pathologies. Ce type d’analyse répond à la question : « Où, dans le cerveau et à l’échelle d’une cohorte de sujets/patients, y a-t-il des associations entre la pathologie et le signal associé à de l’imagerie structurelle ou fonctionnelle ? » Ce type d’analyse n’a pas de pouvoir prédictif nécessaire pour aider au diagnostic ou au pronostic de la réponse à un traitement à un niveau individuel. De plus, ces analyses impliquent généralement l’examen de chaque voxel (locus de mesure du signal) séparément les uns des autres, ce qui empêche l’identification de « patterns » impliquant conjointement plusieurs régions cérébrales. Tenant compte du fait que dans les pathologies psychiatriques, les altérations du cerveau impliquent des réseaux largement distribués sur plusieurs régions cérébrales, la communauté de neuroimagerie s’est tournée vers des méthodes de prédiction multivariées en raison de leur capacité à examiner conjointement toutes les régions cérébrales ainsi que pour leur potentiel à produire des inférences au niveau individuel. Cet article donne un aperçu critique des applications actuelles des méthodes de prédiction multivariées dans le cadre des maladies mentales. Nous abordons l’identification de biomarqueurs fondée sur la neuroimagerie dans la perspective d’utiliser ces derniers pour le diagnostic, la détection précoce et la réponse au traitement.
Abstract
The study of mental illness (mood disorders, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder) in neuroimaging has been addressed by standard “univariate” statistical analysis methods. These methods have revealed many structural and functional brain changes associated with these diseases. Such analysis answers the question: “Where in the brain and on the scale of a cohort of subjects/patients, are the associations between the pathology and any structural or functional related signal”. This type of analysis has no predictive power to assist in the diagnosis or the prognosis of the response to a treatment at an individual level. In addition, these analyses typically involve examining each voxel separately (measured signal at given locus), thus limiting the identification of “patterns” that jointly involve several brain regions. Taking into account the fact that brain alterations in psychiatric diseases expand over a widely distributed network of brain regions, the neuroimaging community turned to multivariate predictive methods because of their ability to examine voxels jointly and their potential for making inferences at a single-subject level. This article provides a critical overview of the current applications of multivariate prediction methods for the identification of biomarkers based on neuroimaging in the prospect of using these for the diagnosis, early detection and response to treatment of mental illness.},

Animal models of repeated stress represent valuable tools to identify region-specific volumetric changes in the brain. Here, using high resolution 7T MRI, we found that amygdala is the most significant parameter for distinction between F344 and SD rats known to have differential response to stress. A significant substantial increase (45\%) was found in the amygdala volume of rats that do not habituate to the repeated stress procedure (F344 rats) compared to SD rats. This strain-specific effect of stress was evidenced by a significant strain-by-stress interaction. There were no significant strain differences in the volumes of hippocampi and prefrontal cortices though stress produces significant reductions of smaller amplitude in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (9\% and 12\%) and dorsal hippocampus (5\% and 6\%) in both strains. Our data further demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of high isotropic resolution structural ex vivo 7T MRI in the study of the brain effects of stress in small animals. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool to follow up brain volumetric reorganization during the stress response and could also be easily used to test pharmacological interventions to prevent the deleterious effects of stress.},

	abstract = {Traditional inference in neuroimaging consists in describing brain activations elicited and modulated by different kinds of stimuli. Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects.},

A partial clustering algorithm using bootstrap sampling and bagging (PCBB) is devised for cortical pattern mining. Partial clusters are found using a modified hierarchical clustering method constrained by an objective function which looks for the most compact and dissimilar clusters. Bagging is used to increase stability. Experiments on simulated and real datasets are used to demonstrate the strength and stability of this algorithm compared to other standard approaches. Some cortical patterns are found using our method. In particular, the patterns found for the left cingulate sulcus are consistent with the patterns described in the atlas of Ono.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of cortical folding may provide insight into neurodevelopment deviations, which, in turn, can predispose to depression that responds particularly poorly to medications. We hypothesized that patients with treatment-resistant depression would exhibit measurable alterations in cortical folding.
METHODS: We computed hemispheric global sulcal indices (g-SIs) in T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained from 76 patients and 70 healthy controls. We separately searched for anatomic deviations in patients with bipolar disorder (16 patients with treatment-resistant depression, 25 with euthymia) and unipolar depression (35 patients with treatment-resistant depression).
RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both groups of patients with treatment-resistant depression exhibited reduced g-SIs: in the right hemisphere among patients with bipolar disorder and in both hemispheres among those with unipolar depression. Patients with euthymic bipolar disorder did not differ significantly from depressed patients or healthy controls. Among patients with bipolar disorder who were taking lithium, we found positive correlations between current lithium dose and g-SIs in both hemispheres.
LIMITATIONS: We cannot estimate the extent to which the observed g-SI reductions are linked to treatment resistance and to what extent they are state-dependent. Furthermore, we cannot disentangle the impact of medications from that of the affective disorder. Finally, there is interindividual variation and overlap of g-SIs among patients and healthy controls that need to be considered when interpreting our results.
CONCLUSION: Reduced global cortical folding surface appears to be characteristic of patients with treatment-resistant depression, either unipolar or bipolar. In patients with bipolar disorder, treatment with lithium may modify cortical folding surface.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebral abnormalities have been detected in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In comparison to BD with a later onset, early-onset BD has been found to have a poorer outcome. However, it is yet unknown whether neuroanatomical abnormalities differ between age-at-onset subgroups of the illness. We searched for cortical folding differences between early-onset (before 25 years) and intermediate-onset (between 25 and 45 years) BD patients.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 22 early-onset BD patients, 14 intermediate-onset BD patients, and 50 healthy participants were analyzed using a fully automated method to extract, label, and measure the sulcal area in the whole cortex. Cortical folding was assessed by computing global sulcal indices (the ratio between total sulcal area and total outer cortex area) for each hemisphere, and local sulcal indices for 12 predefined regions in both hemispheres.
RESULTS: Intermediate-onset BD patients had a significantly reduced local sulcal index in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in comparison to both early-onset BD patients and healthy subjects, and lower global sulcal indices in both hemispheres in comparison to healthy subjects (p {\textless} 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Brain tissue volumes did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first evidence of a neuroanatomic difference between intermediate-onset and early-onset BD, which lends further support to the existence of different age-at-onset subgroups of BD.},

However, rodent organs are small as compared to the scanner's intrinsic resolution and are affected by physiological movements. We present a new method for the segmentation of rodent whole-body PET images that takes these two difficulties into account by estimating the pharmacokinetics far from organ borders. The segmentation method proved efficient on whole-body numerical rat phantom simulations, including 3-14 organs, together with physiological movements (heart beating, breathing, and bladder filling). The method was resistant to spillover and physiological movements, while other methods failed to obtain a correct segmentation. The radioactivity concentrations calculated with this method also showed an excellent correlation with the manual delineation of organs in a large set of preclinical images. In addition, it was faster, detected more organs, and extracted organs' mean time activity curves with a better confidence on the measure than manual delineation.},

	abstract = {The dopamine (DA) system is known to be involved in the reward and dependence mechanisms of addiction. However, modifications in dopaminergic neurotransmission associated with long-term tobacco and cannabis use have been poorly documented in vivo. In order to assess striatal and extrastriatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in tobacco and cannabis addiction, three groups of male age-matched subjects were compared: 11 healthy non-smoker subjects, 14 tobacco-dependent smokers (17.6 ± 5.3 cigarettes/day for 12.1 ± 8.5 years) and 13 cannabis and tobacco smokers (CTS) (4.8 ± 5.3 cannabis joints/day for 8.7 ± 3.9 years). DAT availability was examined in positron emission tomography (HRRT) with a high resolution research tomograph after injection of [11C]PE2I, a selective DAT radioligand. Region of interest and voxel-by-voxel approaches using a simplified reference tissue model were performed for the between-group comparison of DAT availability. Measurements in the dorsal striatum from both analyses were concordant and showed a mean 20\% lower DAT availability in drug users compared with controls. Whole-brain analysis also revealed lower DAT availability in the ventral striatum, the midbrain, the middle cingulate and the thalamus (ranging from -15 to -30\%). The DAT availability was slightly lower in all regions in CTS than in subjects who smoke tobacco only, but the difference does not reach a significant level. These results support the existence of a decrease in DAT availability associated with tobacco and cannabis addictions involving all dopaminergic brain circuits. These findings are consistent with the idea of a global decrease in cerebral DA activity in dependent subjects.},

	abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach.},

	abstract = {Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images for diagnosis of a clinical condition. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV) enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.},

	abstract = {A sensitive marker for monitoring progression of early Alzheimer's disease would help to develop and test new therapeutic strategies. The present study is aimed at investigating brain metabolism changes over time, as a potential monitoring marker, in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, according to their clinical outcome (converters or non-converters), and in relation to their cognitive decline. Seventeen amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and 18FDG-positron emission tomography scans both at inclusion and 18 months later. Baseline and follow-up positron emission tomography data were corrected for partial volume effects and spatially normalized using magnetic resonance imaging data, scaled to the vermis and compared using SPM2. 'PET-PAC' maps reflecting metabolic per cent annual changes were created for correlation analyses with cognitive decline. In the whole sample, the greatest metabolic decrease concerned the posterior cingulate-precuneus area. Converters had significantly greater metabolic decrease than non-converters in two ventro-medial prefrontal areas, the subgenual (BA25) and anterior cingulate (BA24/32). PET-PAC in BA25 and BA24/32 combined allowed complete between-group discrimination. BA25 PET-PAC significantly correlated with both cognitive decline and PET-PAC in the hippocampal region and temporal pole, while BA24/32 PET-PAC correlated with posterior cingulate PET-PAC. Finally, the metabolic change in BA8/9/10 was inversely related to that in BA25 and showed relative increase with cognitive decline, suggesting that compensatory processes may occur in this dorso-medial prefrontal region. The observed ventro-medial prefrontal disruption is likely to reflect disconnection from the hippocampus, both indirectly through the cingulum bundle and posterior cingulate cortex for BA24/32, and directly through the uncinate fasciculus for BA25. Altogether, our findings emphasize the potential of 18FDG-positron emission tomography for monitoring early Alzheimer's disease progression.},

Postmortem studies and, more recently, structural MR imaging studies have described qualitatively the heterogeneous spatiotemporal progression of white matter myelination. However, in vivo quantification of the maturation phases of fiber bundles is still lacking. We used noninvasive diffusion tensor MR imaging and tractography in twenty-three 1-4-month-old healthy infants to quantify the early maturation of the main cerebral fascicles. A specific maturation model, based on the respective roles of different maturational processes on the diffusion phenomena, was designed to highlight asynchronous maturation across bundles by evaluating the time-course of mean diffusivity and anisotropy changes over the considered developmental period. Using an original approach, a progression of maturation in four relative stages was determined in each tract by estimating the maturation state and speed, from the diffusion indices over the infants group compared with an adults group on one hand, and in each tract compared with the average over bundles on the other hand. Results were coherent with, and extended previous findings in 8 of 11 bundles, showing the anterior limb of the internal capsule and cingulum as the most immature, followed by the optic radiations, arcuate and inferior longitudinal fascicles, then the spinothalamic tract and fornix, and finally the corticospinal tract as the most mature bundle. Thus, this approach provides new quantitative landmarks for further noninvasive research on brain-behavior relationships during normal and abnormal development.},

	abstract = {PET scanners devoted to in vivo functional study have recently been developed, but autoradiography remains the reference technique for assessing cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRGlu) in rodents. Autoradiographs are conventionally subjected to region of interest (ROI) analysis, which is intrinsically hypothesis-driven and therefore not suitable for whole-brain investigation. Voxel-wise statistical methods of analysis have long been used to determine differences in brain activity during in vivo functional neuroimaging experiments. They have also recently been applied to 3D reconstructed autoradiographic volume images from rat brains. We present here a fully automated analysis for autoradiographic data combining (1) computerized procedures for the acquisition and 3D reconstruction of postmortem volume images and (2) spatial normalization followed by classical whole-brain voxel-wise statistical analysis. We also describe an additional procedure for characterizing functional differences between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. We compared two spatial normalization techniques and evaluated how the effect of choosing a particular normalization technique impacted on the statistical analysis. We also propose a small volume correction analysis to address the problem of multiple statistical comparisons. Lastly, we investigated the reliability of such analyses, by comparing their results qualitatively and quantitatively with those previously obtained with our semiautomated ROI-based analysis [Dubois, A., Dauguet, J., Herard, A.-S., Besret, L., Duchesnay, E., Frouin, V., Hantraye, P., Bonvento, G., Delzescaux, T., 2007.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Tractography studies investigating white matter (WM) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder have yielded heterogeneous results owing to small sample sizes. The small size limits their generalizability, a critical issue for neuroimaging studies of biomarkers of bipolar I disorder (BPI).
OBJECTIVES: To study WM abnormalities using whole-brain tractography in a large international multicenter sample of BPI patients and to compare these alterations between patients with or without a history of psychotic features during mood episodes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, multicenter, international, Q-ball imaging tractography study comparing 118 BPI patients and 86 healthy control individuals. In addition, among the patient group, we compared those with and without a history of psychotic features. University hospitals in France, Germany, and the United States contributed participants.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent assessment using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies at the French sites or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV at the German and US sites. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired using the same acquisition parameters and scanning hardware at each site. We reconstructed 22 known deep WM tracts using Q-ball imaging tractography and an automatized segmentation technique.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized fractional anisotropy values along each reconstructed WM tract.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, BPI patients had significant reductions in mean generalized fractional anisotropy values along the body and the splenium of the corpus callosum, the left cingulum, and the anterior part of the left arcuate fasciculus when controlling for age, sex, and acquisition site (corrected for multiple testing). Patients with a history of psychotic features had a lower mean generalized fractional anisotropy value than those without along the body of the corpus callosum (corrected for multiple testing).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter sample, BPI patients had reduced WM integrity in interhemispheric, limbic, and arcuate WM tracts. Interhemispheric pathways are more disrupted in patients with than in those without psychotic symptoms. Together these results highlight the existence of an anatomic disconnectivity in BPI and further underscore a role for interhemispheric disconnectivity in the pathophysiological features of psychosis in BPI.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorders (BDs) are among the leading causes of morbidity and disability. Objective biological markers, such as those based on brain imaging, could aid in clinical management of BD. Machine learning (ML) brings neuroimaging analyses to individual subject level and may potentially allow for their diagnostic use. However, fair and optimal application of ML requires large, multi-site datasets. We applied ML (support vector machines) to MRI data (regional cortical thickness, surface area, subcortical volumes) from 853 BD and 2167 control participants from 13 cohorts in the ENIGMA consortium. We attempted to differentiate BD from control participants, investigated different data handling strategies and studied the neuroimaging/clinical features most important for classification. Individual site accuracies ranged from 45.23\% to 81.07\%. Aggregate subject-level analyses yielded the highest accuracy (65.23\%, 95\% CI = 63.47-67.00, ROC-AUC = 71.49\%, 95\% CI = 69.39-73.59), followed by leave-one-site-out cross-validation (accuracy = 58.67\%, 95\% CI = 56.70-60.63). Meta-analysis of individual site accuracies did not provide above chance results. There was substantial agreement between the regions that contributed to identification of BD participants in the best performing site and in the aggregate dataset (Cohen's Kappa = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.829-0.831). Treatment with anticonvulsants and age were associated with greater odds of correct classification. Although short of the 80\% clinically relevant accuracy threshold, the results are promising and provide a fair and realistic estimate of classification performance, which can be achieved in a large, ecologically valid, multi-site sample of BD participants based on regional neurostructural measures. Furthermore, the significant classification in different samples was based on plausible and similar neuroanatomical features. Future multi-site studies should move towards sharing of raw/voxelwise neuroimaging data.},

Multivariate recognition methods are required for the detection of complex brain patterns with a spatial distribution.

We overcame this problem, using a classifier pipeline with one- or two-stage of descriptor selection based on machine-learning methods, followed by a support vector machine classifier or linear discriminant analysis. We compared alternative designs of the pipeline on two different datasets built from the same database corresponding to 151 brains. The first dataset dealt with cortex asymmetry and the second dealt with the effect of the subject's sex. Our system successfully (98\%) distinguished between the left and right hemispheres on the basis of sulcal shape (size, depth, etc.). The sex of the subject could be determined with a success rate of 85\%. These results highlight the attractiveness of multivariate recognition models combined with appropriate descriptor selection. The sulci selected by the pipeline are consistent with previous whole-brain studies on sex effects and hemispheric asymmetries.},

	doi = {10.1038/tp.2016.283},
	abstract = {In today's society, every individual is subjected to stressful stimuli with different intensities and duration. This exposure can be a key trigger in several mental illnesses greatly affecting one's quality of life. Yet not all subjects respond equally to the same stimulus and some are able to better adapt to them delaying the onset of its negative consequences. The neural specificities of this adaptation can be essential to understand the true dynamics of stress as well as to design new approaches to reduce its consequences. In the current work, we employed ex vivo high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to uncover the differences in white matter properties in the entire brain between Fisher 344 (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, known to present different responses to stress, and to examine the effects of a 2-week repeated inescapable stress paradigm. We applied a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis approach to a total of 25 animals. After exposure to stress, SD rats were found to have lower values of corticosterone when compared with F344 rats. Overall, stress was found to lead to an overall increase in fractional anisotropy (FA), on top of a reduction in mean and radial diffusivity (MD and RD) in several white matter bundles of the brain. No effect of strain on the white matter diffusion properties was observed. The strain-by-stress interaction revealed an effect on SD rats in MD, RD and axial diffusivity (AD), with lower diffusion metric levels on stressed animals. These effects were localized on the left side of the brain on the external capsule, corpus callosum, deep cerebral white matter, anterior commissure, endopiriform nucleus, dorsal hippocampus and amygdala fibers. The results possibly reveal an adaptation of the SD strain to the stressful stimuli through synaptic and structural plasticity processes, possibly reflecting learning processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunes are a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease. Although still debated, the morphological features of lacunes may offer mechanistic insights. We systematically analyzed the shape of incident lacunes in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a genetically defined small vessel disease.
METHODS: A total of 88 incident lacunes from 57 patients were segmented from 3-dimensional T1 magnetic resonance images and 3 dimensionally reconstructed. Anatomic location, diameter, volume, surface area, and compactness of lacunes were assessed. The shape was analyzed using a size, orientation, and position invariant spectral shape descriptor. We further investigated the relationship with perforating arteries and fiber tracts.
RESULTS: Lacunes were most abundant in the centrum semiovale and the basal ganglia. Diameter, volume, and surface area of lacunes in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were larger than in other brain regions. The spectral shape descriptor revealed a continuum of shapes with no evidence for distinct classes of lacunes. Shapes varied mostly in elongation and planarity. The main axis and plane of lacunes were found to align with the orientation of perforating arteries but not with fiber tracts.
CONCLUSIONS: Elongation and planarity are the primary shape principles of lacunes. Their main axis and plane align with perforating arteries. Our findings add to current concepts on the mechanisms of lacunes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To obtain simple models predicting disease evolution at 3 years for a given patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
METHODS: Based on data obtained in a prospective study of 236 patients, we built and validated models predicting, at the individual level, 3-year changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), Trail Making Test version B (TMTB), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). These models were based on different sets of predictors obtained at baseline, including either clinical data (epidemiologic data and cardiovascular risk factors) or clinical data and quantitative MRI markers (volume of lacunes [LLV], volume of white matter hyperintensities, normalized brain volume [BPF], number of microbleeds). The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were used to determine models with the highest predictive ability and the lowest numbers of predictors.
RESULTS: We obtained validated models with a demonstrated ability to predict, for a given patient, 3-year changes in MMSE, MDRS, TMTB, and mRS (R2 on independent samples: 0.22, 0.12, 0.09, and 0.17, respectively). In all cases, the best models according to R2 and BIC values included only the baseline values of the outcome, of BPF, and of LLV. Inclusion of other potential predictors always led to a loss of generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of 3-year changes in MMSE, MDRS, TMTB, and mRS for a given patient with CADASIL can be obtained using simple models relying only on the initial values of the considered score, BPF, and LLV.},

	abstract = {In a recent postmortem study, R2* relaxometry in gray matter (GM) of the brain has been validated as a noninvasive measure for iron content in brain tissue. Iron accumulation in the normal aging brain is a common finding and relates to brain maturation and degeneration. The goal of this study was to assess the determinants of iron accumulation during brain aging. The study cohort consisted of 314 healthy community-dwelling participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study. Their age ranged from 38-82 years. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 3T and included R2* mapping, based on a 3D multi-echo gradient echo sequence. The median of R2* values was measured in all GM regions, which were segmented automatically using FreeSurfer. We investigated 25 possible determinants for cerebral iron deposition. These included demographics, brain volume, lifestyle factors, cerebrovascular risk factors, serum levels of iron, and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to iron regulating genes (rs1800562, rs3811647, rs1799945, and rs1049296). The body mass index (BMI) was significantly related to R2* in 15/32 analyzed brain regions with the strongest correlations found in the amygdala (p = 0.0091), medial temporal lobe (p = 0.0002), and hippocampus (p ≤ 0.0001). Further associations to R2* values were found in deep GM for age and smoking. No significant associations were found for gender, GM volume, serum levels of iron, or iron-associated genetic polymorphisms. In conclusion, besides age, the BMI and smoking are the only significant determinants of brain iron accumulation in normally aging subjects. Smoking relates to iron deposition in the basal ganglia, whereas higher BMI is associated with iron content in the neocortex following an Alzheimer-like distribution.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., -dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.},

	abstract = {Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images to decode cognitive states or diagnosis/prognosis of a clinical condition/evolution. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total variation (TV) is a promising candidate for structured penalization: it enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties. However, reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed to unacceptable levels. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed toward any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the To propose an expression of the duality convergence speed. This expression is applicable to many penalties and can be used with other solvers than CONESTA. We also propose an expression for the particular smoothing parameter that minimizes the number of iterations required to reach a given precision. Furthermore, we provide a convergence proof and its rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Structural MRI (sMRI) increasingly offers insight into abnormalities inherent to schizophrenia. Previous machine learning applications suggest that individual classification is feasible and reliable and, however, is focused on the predictive performance of the clinical status in cross-sectional designs, which has limited biological perspectives. Moreover, most studies depend on relatively small cohorts or single recruiting site. Finally, no study controlled for disease stage or medication's effect. These elements cast doubt on previous findings' reproducibility.
METHOD: We propose a machine learning algorithm that provides an interpretable brain signature. Using large datasets collected from 4 sites (276 schizophrenia patients, 330 controls), we assessed cross-site prediction reproducibility and associated predictive signature. For the first time, we evaluated the predictive signature regarding medication and illness duration using an independent dataset of first-episode patients.
RESULTS: Machine learning classifiers based on neuroanatomical features yield significant intersite prediction accuracies (72\%) together with an excellent predictive signature stability. This signature provides a neural score significantly correlated with symptom severity and the extent of cognitive impairments. Moreover, this signature demonstrates its efficiency on first-episode psychosis patients (73\% accuracy).
CONCLUSION: These results highlight the existence of a common neuroanatomical signature for schizophrenia, shared by a majority of patients even from an early stage of the disorder.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences of cortical morphology between HC, MCI, and AD patients using a new post-processing method based on reconstruction and identification of cortical sulci. Thirty HC, 33 MCI, and 30 AD patients were randomly selected from the ADNI database. For each subject, cortical sulci were reconstructed and automatically identified using Brainvisa software. Depth and fold opening of nine large sulci were compared between HC, MCI, and AD patients. Fold opening of parietaloccipital fissure and intraparietal sulcus on both sides strongly differed between the 3 groups, with gradual increase from HC to MCI of about 1 mm and from MCI to AD of about 2 mm (right intraparietal: p = 0.005; left intraparietal: p = 0.004; right parietaloccipital: p = 0.003; left parietaloccipital: p = 0.0009). Results were left unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, and level of education. These variables were also strongly linked to neuropsychological scores, independent of age, gender, and level of education. In the present study, we found important regional differences of cortical morphology with gradual deterioration from HC to MCI to AD.

METHODS: A total of 584 community-dwelling elderly underwent brain MRI followed by segmentation of white matter hyperintensities. Processing speed was determined by the timed measure of the Trail Making Test part B. The impact of the location of white matter hyperintensities was assessed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and graph-based statistical models on regional lesion volumes in major white matter tracts.
RESULTS: Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping identified multiple voxel clusters where the presence of white matter hyperintensities was associated with slower performance on the Trail Making Test part B. Clusters were located bilaterally in the forceps minor and anterior thalamic radiation. Region of interest-based Bayesian network analyses on lesion volumes within major white matter tracts depicted the same tracts as direct predictors for an impaired Trail Making Test part B performance.

Whether a motor reserve also modulates the relationships between stroke and disability is unknown. We aimed to determine whether the shape of the central sulcus, a marker of the development of underlying motor connections, is independently associated with disability in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Shapes of central sulci were reconstructed from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and ordered without supervision according to a validated algorithm in 166 patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke caused by CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy With Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), a severe monogenic cerebral small vessel disease affecting young patients. Ordinal logistic regression modeling was used to test the relationships between modified Rankin scale, a disability scale strongly weighted toward motor disability, and sulcal shape.
RESULTS: Modified Rankin scale was strongly associated with sulcal shape, independent of age, sex, and level of education (proportional odds ratio =1.19, 95\% confidence interval =1.06-1.35; P=0.002). Results remained significant after further adjustment for brain atrophy, volume of lacunes, and volume of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of disability in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke caused by a severe cerebral small vessel disease is related to the shape of the central sulcus, independently of the main determinants of disability. These results support the concept of a motor reserve that could modulate the clinical severity in patients with a positive history of small subcortical ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Objective: In CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered to result from hypoperfusion. We hypothesized that in fact the burden of WMH results from the combination of several regional populations of WMH with different mechanisms and clinical consequences. Methods: To identify regional WMH populations, we used a 4-step approach. First, we used an unsupervised principal component algorithm to determine, without a priori knowledge, the main sources of variation of the global spatial pattern of WMH. Thereafter, to determine whether these sources are likely to include relevant information regarding regional populations of WMH, we tested their relationships with: (1) MRI markers of the disease; (2) the clinical severity assessed by the Mattis Dementia Rating scale (MDRS) (cognitive outcome) and the modified Rankin's score (disability outcome). Finally, through careful interpretation of all the results, we tried to identify different regional populations of WMH. Results: The unsupervised principal component algorithm identified 3 main sources of variation of the global spatial pattern of WMH, which showed significant and sometime inverse relationships with MRI markers and clinical scores. The models predicting clinical severity based on these sources outperformed those evaluating WMH by their volume (MDRS, coefficient of determination of 39.0 vs. 35.3\%, p = 0.01; modified Rankin's score, 43.7 vs. 38.1\%, p = 0.001). By carefully interpreting the visual aspect of these sources as well as their relationships with MRI markers and clinical severity, we found strong arguments supporting the existence of different regional populations of WMH. For instance, in multivariate analyses, larger extents of WMH in anterior temporal poles and superior frontal gyri were associated with better outcomes, while larger extents of WMH in pyramidal tracts were associated with worse outcomes, which could not be explained if WMH in these different areas shared the same mechanisms. Conclusion: The results of the present study support the hypothesis that the whole extent of WMH results from a combination of different regional populations of WMH, some of which are associated, for yet undetermined reasons, with milder forms of the disease.},

	abstract = {Building accurate Deep Learning (DL) models for brain age prediction is a very relevant topic in neuroimaging, as it could help better understand neurodegenerative disorders and find new biomarkers. To estimate accurate and generalizable models, large datasets have been collected, which are often multi-site and multi-scanner. This large heterogeneity negatively affects the generalization performance of DL models since they are prone to overfit site-related noise. Recently, contrastive learning approaches have been shown to be more robust against noise in data or labels. For this reason, we propose a novel contrastive learning regression loss for robust brain age prediction using MRI scans. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenBHB challenge, yielding the best generalization capability and robustness to site-related noise.},

	abstract = {The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (ℓ2 penalty) or scattered (ℓ1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of ℓ1, ℓ2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact ℓ1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions.},

It determines how positive samples are defined and, ultimately, the quality of the learnt representation. In this work, we open the door to new perspectives for CL by integrating prior knowledge, given either by generative models-viewed as prior representations-or weak attributes in the positive and negative sampling. To this end, we use kernel theory to propose a novel loss, called decoupled uniformity, that i) allows the integration of prior knowledge and ii) removes the negative-positive coupling in the original InfoNCE loss. We draw a connection between contrastive learning and conditional mean embedding theory to derive tight bounds on the downstream classification loss. In an unsupervised setting, we empirically demonstrate that CL benefits from generative models to improve its representation both on natural and medical images. In a weakly supervised scenario, our framework outperforms other unconditional and conditional CL approaches. Source code is available at this https URL.},

	abstract = {Traditional supervised learning with deep neural networks requires a tremendous amount of labelled data to converge to a good solution. For 3D medical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated dataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to learn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural network. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by (almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks. Nonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such as participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage continuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by introducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve the positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with similar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar discriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for three classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's detection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on these tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is made publicly available here.},

	abstract = {Contrastive Learning has shown impressive results on natural and medical images, without requiring annotated data. However, a particularity of medical images is the availability of meta-data (such as age or sex) that can be exploited for learning representations. Here, we show that the recently proposed contrastive y-Aware InfoNCE loss, that integrates multi-dimensional meta-data, asymptotically optimizes two properties: conditional alignment and global uniformity. Similarly to [33], conditional alignment means that similar samples should have similar features, but conditionally on the meta-data. Instead, global uniformity means that the (normalized) features should be uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere, independently of the meta-data. Here, we propose to define conditional uniformity, relying on the meta-data, that repel only samples with dissimilar metadata. We show that direct optimization of both conditional alignment and uniformity improves the representations, in terms of linear evaluation, on both CIFAR-100 and a brain MRI dataset.},

	abstract = {In the imaging genetics field, the classical univariate approach ignores the potential joint effects between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate exploratory multivariate methods, namely partial least squares regression or canonical correlation analysis, in order to identify a set of genetic polymorphisms covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes. However, in high-dimensional settings, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus, we investigate the use of different strategies of regularization and dimension reduction, combined with PLS or CCA, to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and assess the capacity of good detection. Univariate selection seems necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the best results are obtained by combining univariate filtering and L1-regularized PLS, which suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach.},

	abstract = {Contrastive Analysis is a sub-field of Representation Learning that aims at separating 1) salient factors of variation - that only exist in the target dataset (i.e., diseased subjects) in contrast with 2) common factors of variation between target and background (i.e., healthy subjects) datasets. Despite their relevance, current models based on Variational Auto-Encoders have shown poor performance in learning semantically-expressive representations. On the other hand, Contrastive Representation Learning has shown tremendous performance leaps in various applications (classification, clustering, etc.). In this work, we propose to leverage the ability of Contrastive Learning to learn semantically expressive representations when performing Contrastive Analysis. Namely, we reformulate Contrastive Analysis under the lens of the InfoMax Principle and identify two Mutual Information terms to maximize and one to minimize. We decompose the two first terms into an Alignment and a Uniformity term, as commonly done in Contrastive Learning. Then, we motivate a novel Mutual Information minimization strategy to prevent information leakage between common and salient distributions. We validate our method on datasets designed to assess the pattern separation capability in Contrastive Analysis, including MNIST superimposed on CIFAR10, CelebA accessories, dSprites item superimposed on a digit grid, and three medical datasets.},

To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e., proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both datasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA).

	abstract = {Subtype Discovery consists in finding interpretable and consistent sub-parts of a dataset, which are also relevant to a certain supervised task. From a mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9 points in terms of balanced accuracy. Finally, we make codes and examples available in a scikit-learn-compatible Python package at https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2021\_rlouiset\_ucsl},

Elastic net logistic regression was trained, using CAARMS items at baseline to predict individual evolution between converters (UHR-P) and non-converters (UHR-NP). Elastic-net was used to select the few CAARMS items that best predict the clinical evolution. All validations and significances of predictive models were computed with non-parametric re-sampling strategies that provide robust estimators even when the distributional assumption cannot be guaranteed. Among the 25 CAARMS items, the Elastic net selected 'obsessive-compulsive symptoms' and 'aggression/dangerous behavior' as risk factors for conversion while 'anhedonia' and 'mood swings/lability' were associated with non-conversion at follow-up. In the ten-fold stratified cross-validation, the classification achieved 81.8\% of sensitivity (P = 0.035) and 93.7\% of specificity (P = 0.0016). Non-psychotic prodromal symptoms bring valuable information to improve the prediction of conversion to psychosis. Elastic net logistic regression applied to clinical data is a promising way to switch from group prediction to an individualized prediction.},

Such abnormalities might denote abnormal cortical folding development, which can now be investigated using gyrification measures. Anatomic magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were obtained from 30 schizophrenia patients screened for resistant auditory hallucinations and 28 control subjects. We searched for overall gyrification abnormalities in the whole cortex as well as localized abnormalities in language-related cortex, assuming that gyrification is associated with brain sulcation. A fully automated method was applied to MRIs to extract, label and measure the sulcus area in the whole cortex. Gyrification was assessed using both global and local sulcal indices, respectively the ratio between total sulcal area, or area of each labeled sulcus, and outer cortex area. For both hemispheres, the patients had a lower global sulcal index. The local sulcal index decrease was not homogeneous across the whole cortex. It was more significant in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally, in the left middle frontal sulcus and in the diagonal branch of left sylvian fissure (Broca's area). Findings suggest abnormalities in cortical gyrification in these patients. Sulcal abnormalities in language-related cortex might underlie these patients' particular vulnerability to hallucinations.},

The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Bipolar Disorder Working Group was formed in 2012 to empower discoveries, generate consensus findings and inform future hypothesis-driven studies of BD. Through this effort, over 150 researchers from 20 countries and 55 institutions pool data and resources to produce the largest neuroimaging studies of BD ever conducted. The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group applies standardized processing and analysis techniques to empower large-scale meta- and mega-analyses of multimodal brain MRI and improve the replicability of studies relating brain variation to clinical and genetic data. Initial BD Working Group studies reveal widespread patterns of lower cortical thickness, subcortical volume and disrupted white matter integrity associated with BD. Findings also include mapping brain alterations of common medications like lithium, symptom patterns and clinical risk profiles and have provided further insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of BD. Here we discuss key findings from the BD working group, its ongoing projects and future directions for large-scale, collaborative studies of mental illness.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The existence of anatomo-functional brain abnormalities in Bipolar Disorder (BD) is now well established by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. To create diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as identifying biologically valid subtypes of BD, research has recently turned towards the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. We assessed both supervised ML and unsupervised ML studies in BD to evaluate their robustness, reproducibility and the potential need for improvement.
METHOD: We systematically searched for studies using ML algorithms based on MRI data of patients with BD until February 2019.
RESULT: We identified 47 studies, 45 using supervised ML techniques and 2 including unsupervised ML analyses. Among supervised studies, 43 focused on diagnostic classification. The reported accuracies for classification of BD ranged between i) 57\% and 100\%, for BD vs. healthy controls (HC); ii) 49.5\% and 93.1\% for BD vs. patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); iii) 50\% and 96.2\% for BD vs. patients with schizophrenia. Reported accuracies for discriminating subjects genetically at risk for BD (either from control or from patients with BD) ranged between 64.3\% and 88.93\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there are strong methodological limitations in previous studies and an important need for replication in large multicentric samples, the conclusions of our review bring hope of future computer aided diagnosis of BD and pave the way for other applications, such as treatment response prediction. To reinforce the reliability of future results we provide methodological suggestions for good practice in conducting and reporting MRI-based ML studies in BD.},

	abstract = {Besides the newly developed positron emission tomography scanners (microPET) dedicated to the in vivo functional study of small animals, autoradiography remains the reference technique widely used for functional brain imaging and the gold standard for the validation of in vivo results. The analysis of autoradiographic data is classically achieved in two dimensions (2D) using a section-by-section approach, is often limited to few sections and the delineation of the regions of interest to be analysed is directly performed on autoradiographic sections. In addition, such approach of analysis does not accommodate the possible anatomical shifts linked to dissymmetry associated with the sectioning process. This classic analysis is time-consuming, operator-dependent and can therefore lead to non-objective and non-reproducible results. In this paper, we have developed an automated and generic toolbox for processing of autoradiographic and corresponding histological rat brain sections based on a three-step approach, which involves: (1) an optimized digitization dealing with hundreds of autoradiographic and histological sections; (2) a robust reconstruction of the volumes based on a reliable registration method; and (3) an original 3D-geometry-based approach to analysis of anatomical and functional post-mortem data. The integration of the toolbox under a unified environment (in-house software BrainVISA, http://brainvisa.info) with a graphic interface enabled a robust and operator-independent exploitation of the overall anatomical and functional information. We illustrated the substantial qualitative and quantitative benefits obtained by applying our methodology to an activation study (rats, n=5, under unilateral visual stimulation).},

	abstract = {Learning with discriminative methods is generally based on minimizing the misclassification of training samples, which may be unsuitable for imbalanced datasets where the recognition might be biased in favor of the most numerous class. This problem can be addressed with a generative approach, which typically requires more parameters to be determined leading to reduced performances in high dimension. In such situations, dimension reduction becomes a crucial issue. We propose a feature selection/classification algorithm based on generative methods in order to predict the clinical status of a highly imbalanced dataset made of PET scans of forty-five low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and thirteen non-ASD low functioning children. ASDs are typically characterized by impaired social interaction, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors, with a high variability in expression and severity. The numerous findings revealed by brain imaging studies suggest that ASD is associated with a complex and distributed pattern of abnormalities that makes the identification of a shared and common neuroimaging profile a difficult task. In this context, our goal is to identify the rest functional brain imaging abnormalities pattern associated with ASD and to validate its efficiency in individual classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm detected a characteristic pattern in the ASD group that included a hypoperfusion in the right Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and a hyperperfusion in the contralateral postcentral area. Our algorithm allowed for a significantly accurate (88\%), sensitive (91\%) and specific (77\%) prediction of clinical category. For this imbalanced dataset, with only 13 control scans, the proposed generative algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art discriminant methods. The high predictive power of the characteristic pattern, which has been automatically identified on whole brains without any priors, confirms previous findings concerning the role of STS in ASD. This work offers exciting possibilities for early autism detection and/or the evaluation of treatment response in individual patients.},

	abstract = {Prediction of chronological age from neuroimaging in the healthy population is an important issue because the deviations from normal brain age may highlight abnormal trajectories towards brain disorders. As a first step, ML models have emerged to predict chronological age from brain MRI, as a proxy measure of biological age. However, there is currently no consensus w.r.t which Machine Learning (ML) model is best suited for this task, largely because of a lack of public benchmark. Furthermore, new large emerging population neuroimaging datasets are often biased by the acquisition center images are coming from. This bias heavily deteriorates models generalization capacities, especially for Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that are known to overfit rapidly on the simplest features (known as simplicity bias). Here we propose a new public benchmarking resource, namely Open Big Healthy Brains (OpenBHB), along with a challenge for both brain age prediction and site-effect removal through a representation learning framework. OpenBHB is large-scale, gathering {\textgreater}5K 3D T1 brain MRI from Healthy Controls (HC) and highly multi-sites, aggregating {\textgreater}60 centers worldwide and 10 studies. OpenBHB is expected to grow both in terms of available modalities and number of subjects. All OpenBHB datasets are uniformly preprocessed, including quality check, with container technologies that consist in: 3D Voxel-Based Morphometry maps (VBM from CAT12), quasi-raw (simple linear alignment of images), and Surface-Based Morphometry indices (SBM, from FreeSurfer). The OpenBHB challenge is permanent and we provide all tools, materials and tutorials for participants to easily submit and benchmark their model against each other on a public leaderboard.},

This study aimed to identify WM abnormalities that differentiate patients with BD from healthy controls (HC) in the largest DTI dataset of patients with BD to date, collected via the ENIGMA network. We gathered individual tensor-derived regional metrics from 26 cohorts leading to a sample size of N = 3033 (1482 BD and 1551 HC). Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from 43 regions of interest (ROI) and average whole-brain FA were entered into univariate mega- and meta-analyses to differentiate patients with BD from HC. Mega-analysis revealed significantly lower FA in patients with BD compared with HC in 29 regions, with the highest effect sizes observed within the corpus callosum (R2 = 0.041, Pcorr {\textless} 0.001) and cingulum (right: R2 = 0.041, left: R2 = 0.040, Pcorr {\textless} 0.001). Lithium medication, later onset and short disease duration were related to higher FA along multiple ROIs. Results of the meta-analysis showed similar effects. We demonstrated widespread WM abnormalities in BD and highlighted that altered WM connectivity within the corpus callosum and the cingulum are strongly associated with BD. These brain abnormalities could represent a biomarker for use in the diagnosis of BD. Interactive three-dimensional visualization of the results is available at www.enigma-viewer.org.},

	abstract = {Background
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) capture aims at detecting auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVHs) from continuously recorded brain activity. Establishing efficient capture methods with low computational cost that easily generalize between patients remains a key objective in precision psychiatry. To address this issue, we developed a novel automatized fMRI-capture procedure for AVHs in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ).
Methods
We used a previously validated but labor-intensive personalized fMRI-capture method to train a linear classifier using machine learning techniques. We benchmarked the performances of this classifier on 2320 AVH periods versus resting-state periods obtained from SCZ patients with frequent symptoms (n = 23). We characterized patterns of blood oxygen level–dependent activity that were predictive of AVH both within and between subjects. Generalizability was assessed with a second independent sample gathering 2000 AVH labels (n = 34 patients with SCZ), while specificity was tested with a nonclinical control sample performing an auditory imagery task (840 labels, n = 20).
Results
Our between-subject classifier achieved high decoding accuracy (area under the curve = 0.85) and discriminated AVH from rest and verbal imagery. Optimizing the parameters on the first schizophrenia dataset and testing its performance on the second dataset led to an out-of-sample area under the curve of 0.85 (0.88 for the converse test). We showed that AVH detection critically depends on local blood oxygen level–dependent activity patterns within Broca's area.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that it is possible to reliably detect AVH states from fMRI blood oxygen level–dependent signals in patients with SCZ using a multivariate decoder without performing complex preprocessing steps. These findings constitute a crucial step toward brain-based treatments for severe drug-resistant hallucinations.},

	abstract = {In fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), brain growth deficiency is a hallmark of subjects both with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and with non-syndromic FASD (NS-FASD, i.e., those without specific diagnostic features). However, although the cerebellum was suggested to be more severely undersized than the rest of the brain, it has not yet been given a specific place in the FASD diagnostic criteria where neuroanatomical features still count for little if anything in diagnostic specificity. We applied a combination of cerebellar segmentation tools on a 1.5 T 3DT1 brain MRI dataset from a monocentric population of 89 FASD (52 FAS, 37 NS-FASD) and 126 typically developing controls (6–20 years old), providing 8 volumes: cerebellum, vermis and 3 lobes (anterior, posterior, inferior), plus total brain volume. After adjustment of confounders, the allometric scaling relationship between these cerebellar volumes (Vi) and the total brain or cerebellum volume (Vt) was fitted (Vi = bVta), and the effect of group (FAS, control) on allometric scaling was evaluated. We then estimated for each cerebellar volume in the FAS population the deviation from the typical scaling (vDTS) learned in the controls. Lastly, we trained and tested two classifiers to discriminate FAS from controls, one based on the total cerebellum vDTS only, the other based on all the cerebellar vDTS, comparing their performance both in the FAS and the NS-FASD group. Allometric scaling was significantly different between FAS and control group for all the cerebellar volumes (p {\textless} .001). We confirmed the excess of total cerebellum volume deficit (vDTS = −10.6\%) and revealed an antero-inferior-posterior gradient of volumetric undersizing in the hemispheres (−12.4\%, 1.1\%, 2.0\%, respectively) and the vermis (−16.7\%, −9.2\%, −8.6\%, repectively). The classifier based on the intracerebellar gradient of vDTS performed more efficiently than the one based on total cerebellum vDTS only (AUC = 92\% vs. 82\%, p = .001). Setting a high probability threshold for {\textgreater}95\% specificity of the classifiers, the gradient-based classifier identified 35\% of the NS-FASD to have a FAS cerebellar phenotype, compared to 11\% with the cerebellum-only classifier (pFISHER = 0.027). In a large series of FASD, this study details the volumetric undersizing within the cerebellum at the lobar and vermian level using allometric scaling, revealing an anterior-inferior-posterior gradient of vulnerability to prenatal alcohol exposure. It also strongly suggests that this intracerebellar gradient of volumetric undersizing may be a reliable neuroanatomical signature of FAS that could be used to improve the specificity of the diagnosis of NS-FASD.},

	abstract = {AIM: Neuroimaging-based machine-learning predictions of psychosis onset rely on the hypothesis that structural brain anomalies may reflect the underlying pathophysiology. Yet, current predictors remain difficult to interpret in light of brain structure. Here, we combined an advanced interpretable supervised algorithm and a model of neuroanatomical age to identify the level of brain maturation of the regions most predictive of psychosis.
METHODS: We used the voxel-based morphometry of a healthy control dataset (N = 2024) and a prospective longitudinal UHR cohort (N = 82), of which 27 developed psychosis after one year. In UHR, psychosis was predicted at one year using Elastic-Net-Total-Variation (Enet-TV) penalties within a five-fold cross-validation, providing an interpretable map of distinct predictive regions. Using both the whole brain and each predictive region separately, a brain age predictor was then built and validated in 1605 controls, externally tested in 419 controls from an independent cohort, and applied in UHR. Brain age gaps were computed as the difference between chronological and predicted age, providing a proxy of whole-brain and regional brain maturation.
RESULTS: Psychosis prediction was performant with 80 ± 4\% of area-under-curve and 69 ± 5\% of balanced accuracy (p {\textless} 0.001), and mainly leveraged volumetric increases in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and decreases in the left precentral gyrus and the right orbitofrontal cortex. These regions were predicted to have, respectively, delayed and accelerated maturational patterns.
CONCLUSION: By combining an interpretable supervised model of conversion to psychosis with a brain age predictor, we showed that inter-regional asynchronous brain maturation underlines the predictive signature of psychosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Here we reviewed cases of secondary psychoses associated with brain anomalies, reported over a 20-year period in adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 30 years old. We considered age at first psychotic symptoms, relevant medical history, the nature of psychiatric symptoms, clinical red flags, the nature of the brain anomaly reported, and the underlying disease. We discuss the relevance of each brain area in light of normal brain function, recent case-control studies, and postulated pathophysiology. We show that anomalies in all regions, whether diffuse, multifocal, or highly localized, may lead to psychosis, without necessarily being associated with non-psychiatric symptoms. This underlines the interest of neuroimaging in the initial workup, and supports the hypothesis of psychosis as a global network dysfunction that involves many different regions.},

However, whether they can be relevant pathophysiological biomarkers of psychosis' onset remains unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: We present a longitudinal study of microRNA expression, measured in plasma by high-throughput sequencing at baseline and follow-up, in a prospective cohort of 81 UHR, 35 of whom developed psychosis at follow-up (converters). We combined supervised machine learning and differential graph analysis to assess the relative weighted contribution of each microRNA variation to the difference in outcome and identify outcome-specific networks. We then applied univariate models to the resulting microRNA variations common to both strategies, to interpret them as a function of demographic and clinical covariates.
STUDY RESULTS: We identified 207 microRNA variations that significantly contributed to the classification. The differential network analysis found 276 network-specific correlations of microRNA variations. The combination of both strategies identified 25 microRNAs, whose gene targets were overrepresented in cognition and schizophrenia genome-wide association studies findings. Interpretable univariate models further supported the relevance of miR-150-5p and miR-3191-5p variations in psychosis onset, independent of age, sex, cannabis use, and medication.
CONCLUSIONS: In this first longitudinal study of microRNA variation during conversion to psychosis, we combined 2 methodologically independent data-driven strategies to identify a dynamic epigenetic signature of the emergence of psychosis that is pathophysiologically relevant.},

In the present report, alterations of cortex morphology and their links to clinical worsening were investigated in 190 CADASIL patients followed during 24.4 months. Linear models were used to test relationships between: (1) clinical worsening and changes of depth of cortical sulci and of cortical thickness; (2) alterations of cortical morphology and changes of volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH(v)) and of lacunar lesions (LL(v)). Reduction of sulcal depth was independently associated with increased time to complete trail making test A and B (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.004) and that of cortical thickness to increased disability (modified Rankin's scale, p = 0.008), while brain atrophy was only related to global cognitive worsening (Mattis dementia rating scale, p = 0.002). The impact of volume of lacunar lesions on cortical alterations was larger than that of volume of white matter hyperintensities. Cortical alterations, mainly related to lacunar lesions, evolve parallel to clinical worsening.

	abstract = {Background
The cerebellum contains more than 50\% of the brain neurons and is involved in social cognition. Cerebellar anatomical atypicalities have repeatedly been reported in individuals with autism. However, studies have yielded inconsistent findings, likely because of a lack of statistical power, and did not capture the clinical and neuroanatomical diversity of autism. Our aim was to better understand cerebellar anatomy and its diversity in autism.
Methods
We studied the cerebellar grey matter morphology in 274 individuals with autism and 219 controls of a multicenter European cohort (EU-AIMS LEAP). To ensure the robustness of our results, we conducted lobular parcellation of the cerebellum with two different pipelines in addition to voxel-based morphometry. We performed statistical analyses with linear, multivariate - including normative modeling - and a meta-analytic approach to capture the diversity of cerebellar anatomy in individuals with autism and controls. Last, we performed a dimensional analysis of cerebellar anatomy in an independent cohort of 352 individuals with autism-related symptoms.
Results
We did not find any significant difference in the cerebellum when comparing individuals with autism and controls using linear models. In addition, there were no significant deviations in our normative models in the cerebellum in individuals with autism. Finally, we found no evidence of cerebellar atypicalities related either to age, IQ, sex or social functioning in individuals with autism.
Conclusions
Despite positive results published in the last decade from relatively small samples, our results suggest that there is no striking difference in cerebellar anatomy of individuals with autism.},

Then, their potential to characterize shapes is shown from a principal component analysis of the 12 first invariants computed for 12 different deep brain structures manually drawn for 7 different brains. Finally, these invariants are used to find some correlates of handedness and sex among the shapes of 116 different cortical sulci automatically identified in each of 142 brains of the ICBM database.},

The program has developed a framework of using artificial neuroanatomists that are trained to identify sulci from a database. The framework relies on a renormalization of the brain warping problem, which consists in matching the cortices at the scale of the folds. Another component of the program is the search for the alphabet of the folding patterns, namely, a list of indivisible elementary sulci. The search relies on the study of the cortical folding process using antenatal imaging and on backward simulations of morphogenesis aimed at revealing traces of the embryologic dimples in the mature cortical surface. The importance of sulcal-based morphometry is illustrated by a simple study of the correlates of handedness on asymmetry indices. The study shows for instance that the central sulcus is larger in the dominant hemisphere.},

However, little is known regarding how early transdiagnostic symptoms, in a dimensional framework, are associated with cortical development. Anxiety and irritability are central vulnerability traits for subsequent mood and anxiety disorders. In this study, we investigate how these dimensions are related to structural changes in the brain to understand how they may increase the transition risk to full-blown disorders. Methods: We used the opportunity of an open access developmental cohort, the Healthy Brain Network, to investigate associations between cortical surface markers and irritability and anxiety scores as measured by parents and self-reports. Results: We found that in 658 young people (with a mean age of 11.6) the parental report of irritability is associated with decreased surface area in the bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. Furthermore, parental reports of anxiety were associated with decreased local gyrification index in the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results are consistent with current models of emotion regulation network maturation, showing decreased surface area or gyrification index in regions associated with impaired affective control in mood and anxiety disorders. Our results highlight how dimensional traits may increase vulnerability for these disorders.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal subfields, pivotal to episodic memory, are distinct both in terms of cyto- and myeloarchitectony. Studying the structure of hippocampal subfields in vivo is crucial to understand volumetric trajectories across the lifespan, from the emergence of episodic memory during early childhood to memory impairments found in older adults. However, segmenting hippocampal subfields on conventional MRI sequences is challenging because of their small size. Furthermore, there is to date no unified segmentation protocol for the hippocampal subfields, which limits comparisons between studies. Therefore, we introduced a novel segmentation tool called HSF short for hippocampal segmentation factory, which leverages an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. First, we validated HSF against currently used tools (ASHS, HIPS, and HippUnfold). Then, we used HSF on 3,750 subjects from the HCP development, young adults, and aging datasets to study the effect of age and sex on hippocampal subfields volumes. Firstly, we showed HSF to be closer to manual segmentation than other currently used tools (p {\textless} 0.001), regarding the Dice Coefficient, Hausdorff Distance, and Volumetric Similarity. Then, we showed differential maturation and aging across subfields, with the dentate gyrus being the most affected by age. We also found faster growth and decay in men than in women for most hippocampal subfields. Thus, while we introduced a new, fast and robust end-to-end segmentation tool, our neuroanatomical results concerning the lifespan trajectories of the hippocampal subfields reconcile previous conflicting results.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.
APPROACH: We released a public 3D Capsule Network (3D-AGSCaps, https://github.com/clementpoiret/3D-AGSCaps) and compared it to equivalent architectures using classical convolutions on the automatic segmentation of HSF on small and atypical datasets (incomplete hippocampal inversion, IHI). We tested 3D-AGSCaps on three datasets with manually labeled hippocampi.
RESULTS: Our main results were: (1) 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a better Dice Coefficient compared to CNNs on rotated hippocampi (p=0.004, cohen's d=0.179); (2) on typical subjects, 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a Dice coefficient similar to CNNs while having 15 times fewer parameters (2.285M versus 35.069M). This may greatly facilitate the study of atypical subjects, including healthy and pathological cases like those presenting an IHI.
CONCLUSION: We expect our newly introduced 3D-AGSCaps to allow a more accurate and fully automated segmentation on atypical populations, small datasets, as well as on and large cohorts where manual segmentations are nearly intractable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lithium (Li) is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD). To study its cerebral distribution and association with plasma concentrations, we used 7Li magnetic resonance imaging at 7T in euthymic patients with BD treated with Li carbonate for at least 2 years.
METHODS: Three-dimensional 7Li magnetic resonance imaging scans (N = 21) were acquired with an ultra-short echo-time sequence using a non-Cartesian k-space sampling scheme. Lithium concentrations ([Li]) were estimated using a phantom replacement approach accounting for differential T1 and T2 relaxation effects. In addition to the determination of mean regional [Li] from 7 broad anatomical areas, voxel- and parcellation-based group analyses were conducted for the first time for 7Li magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Using unprecedented spatial sensitivity and specificity, we were able to confirm the heterogeneity of the brain Li distribution and its interindividual variability, as well as the strong correlation between plasma and average brain [Li] ([Li]B ≈ 0.40 × [Li]P, R = .74). Remarkably, our statistical analysis led to the identification of a well-defined and significant cluster corresponding closely to the left hippocampus for which high Li content was displayed consistently across our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This observation could be of interest considering 1) the major role of the hippocampus in emotion processing and regulation, 2) the consistent atrophy of the hippocampus in untreated patients with BD, and 3) the normalization effect of Li on gray matter volumes. This study paves the way for the elucidation of the relationship between Li cerebral distribution and its therapeutic response, notably in newly diagnosed patients with BD.},

While efficient augmentations have been found for standard vision datasets, such as ImageNet, it is still an open problem in other applications, such as medical imaging, or in datasets with easy-to-learn but irrelevant imaging features. In this work, we propose a new way to define positive samples using kernel theory along with a novel loss called decoupled uniformity. We propose to integrate prior information, learnt from generative models or given as auxiliary attributes, into contrastive learning, to make it less dependent on data augmentation. We draw a connection between contrastive learning and the conditional mean embedding theory to derive tight bounds on the downstream classification loss. In an unsupervised setting, we empirically demonstrate that CL benefits from generative models, such as VAE and GAN, to less rely on data augmentations. We validate our framework on vision datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10 and ImageNet100 and a brain MRI dataset. In the weakly supervised setting, we demonstrate that our formulation provides state-of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {The influence of genes on cortical structures has been assessed through various phenotypes. The sulcal pits, which are the putative first cortical folds, have for long been assumed to be under tight genetic control, but this was never quantified. We estimated the pit depth heritability in various brain regions using the high quality and large sample size of the Human Connectome Project pedigree cohort. Analysis of additive genetic variance indicated that their heritability ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 and displays a regional genetic control with an overall symmetric pattern between hemispheres. However, a noticeable asymmetry of heritability estimates is observed in the superior temporal sulcus and could thus be related to language lateralization. The heritability range estimated in this study reinforces the idea that cortical shape is determined primarily by nongenetic factors, which is consistent with the important increase of cortical folding from birth to adult life and thus predominantly constrained by environmental factors. Nevertheless, the genetic cues, implicated with various local levels of heritability in the formation of sulcal pits, play a fundamental role in the normal gyral pattern development. Quantifying their influence and identifying the underlying genetic variants would provide insight into neurodevelopmental disorders.},

We show that this strategy is efficient with a heterogeneous dataset including challenging data as preterm newborns, infants, post mortem histological data and a synthetic atlas computed from averaging the ICBM database, as well as more commonly studied data acquired in vivo in adults.

Sulcus-specific morphometry analysis may help disentangle the contribution of coexisting neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental processes, but such an approach has never been used in HD. Here, we investigated cortical sulcal depth, related to degenerative process, as well as cortical sulcal length, related to developmental process, in early-stage HD and age-matched healthy controls. This morphometric analysis revealed significant differences in the HD participants compared with the healthy controls bilaterally in the central and intra-parietal sulcus, but also in the left intermediate frontal sulcus and calcarine fissure. As the primary visual cortex is not connected to the striatum, the latter result adds to the increasing in vivo evidence for primary cortical degeneration in HD. Those sulcal measures that differed between HD and healthy populations were mainly atrophy-related, showing shallower sulci in HD. Conversely, the sulcal morphometry also revealed a crucial difference in the imprint of the Sylvian fissure that could not be related to loss of grey matter volume: an absence of asymmetry in the length of this fissure in HD. Strong asymmetry in that cortical region is typically observed in healthy development. As the formation of the Sylvian fissure appears early in utero, and marked asymmetry is specifically found in this area of the neocortex in newborns, this novel finding likely indicates the foetal timing of a disease-specific, genetic interplay with neurodevelopment.},

Cortical and local GM volumes were compared using voxel-wise approaches with voxel-based morphometry and SIENAX using FSL. We used multiple linear regression models to test the influence of Li on cortical and local GM volumes, taking into account potential confounding factors such as a history of alcohol misuse.ResultsPatients taking Li had greater cortical GM volume than patients without. Patients undergoing Li had greater regional GM volumes in the right middle frontal gyrus, the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus in comparison with patients not taking Li.ConclusionsOur results in a large multicentric sample support the hypothesis that Li could exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects limiting pathological GM atrophy in key brain regions associated with BD.},

Cerebellar alterations could explain symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, literature suggests that lithium might influence cerebellar anatomy. Our aim was to study cerebellar anatomy in SZ and BD, and investigate the effect of lithium. Methods Participants from 7 centers worldwide underwent a 3T MRI. We included 182 patients with SZ, 144 patients with BD, and 322 controls. We automatically segmented the cerebellum using the CERES pipeline. All outputs were visually inspected. Results Patients with SZ showed a smaller global cerebellar gray matter volume compared to controls, with most of the changes located to the cognitive part of the cerebellum (Crus II and lobule VIIb). This decrease was present in the subgroup of patients with recent-onset SZ. We did not find any alterations in the cerebellum in patients with BD. However, patients medicated with lithium had a larger size of the anterior cerebellum, compared to patients not treated with lithium. Conclusion Our multicenter study supports a distinct pattern of cerebellar alterations in SZ and BD.},

These disorders are multifactorial, resulting from a complex combination of neurodevelopmental and environmental factors. In particular, such factors are present in cortical sulci, whose shapes are determined very early in brain development and are a valuable proxy for capturing specifically the neurodevelopmental contribution of brain anatomy. This paper explores whether the shapes of cortical sulci can be used for diagnosis prediction using deep learning models. These models are applied to three mental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) in large multicentric datasets. We demonstrate that the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of these disorders can be captured withsMRI. Finally, we show the potential of visual explanations of models’ decisions in discovering biomarkers for mental disorders.},

	abstract = {Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a {\textbackslash}textit\{background\} dataset (BG) ({\textbackslash}textit\{i.e.,\} healthy subjects) and a {\textbackslash}textit\{target\} dataset (TG) ({\textbackslash}textit\{i.e.,\} patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset. To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of {\textbackslash}textbf\{salient\} features ({\textbackslash}textit\{i.e.,\} proper to the target dataset) and a set of {\textbackslash}textbf\{common\} features ({\textbackslash}textit\{i.e.,\} exist in both datasets). Currently, all CA-VAEs models fail to prevent sharing of information between the latent spaces and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA).},

	abstract = {The perspective of personalized medicine for brain disorders requires efficient learning models for anatomical neuroimaging-based prediction of clinical conditions. There is now a consensus on the benefit of deep learning (DL) in addressing many medical imaging tasks, such as image segmentation. However, for single-subject prediction problems, recent studies yielded contradictory results when comparing DL with Standard Machine Learning (SML) on top of classical feature extraction. Most existing comparative studies were limited in predicting phenotypes of little clinical interest, such as sex and age, and using a single dataset. Moreover, they conducted a limited analysis of the employed image pre-processing and feature selection strategies. This paper extensively compares DL and SML prediction capacity on five multi-site problems, including three increasingly complex clinical applications in psychiatry namely schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. To compensate for the relative scarcity of neuroimaging data on these clinical datasets, we also evaluate three pre-training strategies for transfer learning from brain imaging of the general healthy population: self-supervised learning, generative modeling and supervised learning with age. Overall, we find similar performance between randomly initialized DL and SML for the three clinical tasks and a similar scaling trend for sex prediction. This was replicated on an external dataset. We also show highly correlated discriminative brain regions between DL and linear ML models in all problems. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training on large-scale healthy population imaging datasets (N≈10k), along with Deep Ensemble, allows DL to learn robust and transferable representations to smaller-scale clinical datasets (N≤1k). It largely outperforms SML on 2 out of 3 clinical tasks both in internal and external test sets. These findings suggest that the improvement of DL over SML in anatomical neuroimaging mainly comes from its capacity to learn meaningful and useful abstract representations of the brain anatomy, and it sheds light on the potential of transfer learning for personalized medicine in psychiatry},
